## Representing numbers

* How are real numbers represented?
* Consider 42.
\(42 = 1 \cdot 2^5 + 0 \cdot 2^4 + 1 \cdot 2^3 + 0 \cdot 2^2 + 1 \cdot 2^1 + 0 \cdot 2^0\)

Hence \(42 = 101010_b\)

However, fractions can not be represented exactly.

## Allocation of 32 bits
 * 1 bit for the sign. (1 for negative, 0 for positive)
 
## Rounding
* Proper rounding: round to nearest even number
* Any .5 number is always rounded to the closest even number to avoid bias. 17.5 -> 18, 16.5 -> 16, 0.1659 -> 0.16 (to two decimal places)
