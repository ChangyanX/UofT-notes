## Object oriented programming
* Modularity
* Information-hiding
* Code re-use
* Pluggability
* SOLID design

## Inheritance Hierarchy
* Object is the root type
* `Object` does not have a parent type, all other Java classes has one parent type.
* If no parent type is declared, it inherits direct from `Object`. 
* `Object` defines methods `toString`, `equals(Object,Object)`, etc. 
* `super` is a pointer to an object that is the type of its superclass.
