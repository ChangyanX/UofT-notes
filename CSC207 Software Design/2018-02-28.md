## Design Patterns
* A general description of a solution to a problem.
* Independent of language

## Pattern Organization
* **Name**
* **Problem**
* **Solution**

## Iterator
* Context
  * A container/collection object
* Problem 
  * Want to iterate over elements of container
  * Want to have multiiple independent iterators over the elements
  * Do not want to expose the underlying representation

## Observer 
* Problem
  * Need to maintain consistency between related objects
  * Two aspects, one dependent on the other.
  * An object should be able to notify other objects without making assumptions about who these objects are.
* Context
  * Superseded by Delegate Event Model
  
## Strategy 
* Problem
  * Multiple classes that differ only in behavior
  * Algorithms should not be implemented within the class
  * The strategy is taken out of the class, and composed as a "Strategy"

## Model-View-Controller
* Model
  * data, rules that govern access to data.
  * stores stuff
* View
  * presentation of that data responsive to changes in the model
    * Push model, view receives changes from the Model
    * Pull model, the View is responsible for calling the model and retrieving the most current data
 * Controller
   * Does everything else
   * Changes the models
