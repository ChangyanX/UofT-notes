## Binary decimal representation

### Converting from binary to decimal

> *Example*
> \(n = 01101010\)
> This is equivalent in decimal to \(2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3 + 2^1 = 64 + 32 + 8 + 2\)

### Decimal to binary
We use two high level algorithms to find the biggest power of two that fits \(n\), then subtract that power while adding a 1 to that position

```python
def find_biggest_power(n):
  i = 0
  while True:
    if 2 ** i > n:
      print(i - 1)
    else:
      i += 1
  
  def dec_to_binary(n):
    while n > 0:
      x = find_biggest_power(n)
      n = n - 2 ** x 
```
## Proof that each natural number has a binary representation
We want to express in symbolic logic *"each natural number can be written as a string of 0s and 1s, which when mulitplied by their position \(i\) equal the value \(n\).*"
A "fudge" representation.
\(\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \exists p \in \mathbb{N}, \exists b_0, b_1, ..., b_p \in \{0, 1\}. n= 0 \lor .b_p = 1 \land \sum_{i=0}^p 2^i b_i = n\) 

We are not allowed to write that there exists a value \(p\), then the number of variables depend on \(p\). To write this formally we would have to define the concepts of length and string, and extract the symbols from the strings of \(0, 1\).

We (informal) use the notation \(a_b\) to represent a binary number. 

Notice that if \(n\) is even, we can just flip the **least significant** digit. For example, \(n = 10\) is written \(1010_b\). \(n=11\) is written \(1011_b\). 

If we have \(n\) is odd, then it is more complicated.  For example, if we have \(n=11\), hence written \(1011_b\) we have to carry the 1 over to get \(1100_b\). However if we ignore the least significant bit (a division by 2) we get the number \(110_b=6\) Then there exists a \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) where \(n + 1 = 2k\). Then the binary representation of \(n+1\) is the binary representation of \(k\) but we shift all but the least significant digits and add a 0.

Hence this is a case of strong induction, as we require to know that \(P(n)\) holds true for all \(n\) up to but excluding \(n+1\). Notice we don't care about the binary representation of \(n\) when \(n\) is odd, but require that an odd \(n\) can be represented in binary from the previous case.

This proof will be an inductive proof over \(n \in \mathbb{N}\).
> **Theorem.** \(\forall m \in \mathbb{N} \forall n \in \mathbb{N}. n \leq m \Rightarrow \exists p \in \mathbb{N}, \exists b_0, b_1, ... b_p \in \{0, 1\}, n = \sum_{i=0}^p 2^i b_i\)

> **Base Case** \(n = 1 \Rightarrow p = 0, b_0 = 1 2^0, b_0 = 1\)
