## Growth Rates
For large values of \(n\), the following inequality holds. 

\(\log_2(n) << (\log_2(n))^2 << n << n \log_2 n<< n^2 < n^3 << 2^n\)

## Analyzing Runtime of Code

.> **Goal**: Find the approximate number of steps that a program takes as a function of input size in the __long term__.

> *Runtime* \(f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}^{\geq 0}\) Where the problem size is a natural number, and the time per basic steps is a real number. 
> Time is an "abstract" concept that measures how long a function takes to compute for large \(n\). 
> We are interested in asymptotic behavior of \(f\), for example \(f \in \Theta(n^2)\). 

## What is a "Basic Step"?
* A basic step generally does not depend on the input size
* Identify blocks of code which can be counted as a single step
* Identify loops that cause basic operations to repeat
* Come up with an expression for runtime \(f\). 
* Use asymptotic notation to find an **elementary function** \(g\) such that \(f \in \Theta(g)\) if possible. 

## Examples
> **Example 1**
```python
def print_sums(list):
  for item1 in list:
    for item2 in list:
      print(item1 + item2)
```
> *What are the basic operations?*
> `print(item1 + item2)` does not matter for size of `list`.
> The outer for loop will execute the inner for loop \(n\) times where \(n\) is the size of `list`. 
> The inner loop will execute print \(n\) times.
> Hence `print_sums` \(\in \Theta(n^2)\).

> **Example 2**
```python
def f(list):
  for item in list:
    for i in range(10):
      print(item + 1)
```
> The following coddeblock
```python
for i in range(10):
      print(item + 1)
```
> Runs in constant time. However, `for item in list` indicates a runtime of size \(n\). Hence `f` \(\in \Theta(n)\). 

<hr>

> **Example 3**
```python
def nested1(n):
  i = 0
  while i < n:
    j = 0
    while j < n:
      print(i+j)
      j = j+z
  i = i+1
  ```
> The outer loop executes \(n\) times, and the inner loop executes \(\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil\). Then we show that \(n \cdot \lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil \in \Theta(n^2)\) by showing it its both in \(O(n^2)\) and \(\Omega(n^2)\).

<hr> 

> **Example 4**
```python
def nested2(n):
  i = 0
  while i < n:
    j = 0
    while j < i:
      print(i+j)
```
> Notice that \(j\) depends on \(i\).
> We have to pick some concrete value of n in order to observe that the inner loop executes \(\Sigma_{i=0}^{n-1} i\) times, which is in \(\Theta(n^2)\). Notice that while the outer loop executes at most `n` times, the inner loop executes `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ...  + n-1` times for each value of `i`. 

> **Exercise** Show that \(\frac{n (n-1)}{2} \in \Theta(n^2)\).
