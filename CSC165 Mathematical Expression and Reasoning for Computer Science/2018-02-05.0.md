## Proof by Contradiction

> *Example*
> **Theorem.** There are infinitely many prime numbers.
> \(\forall n \in \mathbb{N}. \exists p  \in \mathbb{N}.Prime(p) \land p > n\).
> **Proof.** Suppose for contradiction that there are finitely many primes. Formally, \(\exists n \in \mathbb{N}. \forall p \in \mathbb{N}. \neg Prime(p) \lor p \leq n\). We can rewrite the assumption as an implication.
> Take \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) st. \(\forall p \in \mathbb{N}. Prime(p) \Rightarrow p \leq n\)
> Let \(P = {P_1, P_2, ... P_l}\) be the finite set of all primes.
> Let \(P* = P_1 * P_2 *...*P_l + 1\) 
> We will show that \(P* \geq n\). Recall that we have \(P\) to be the set of all primes that are \(\leq n\). If \(P* \leq n\), then \(P* \in P\), but \(\forall i \in \mathbb{N}. P* \neq P_i\), since \(P* = P_i * ... * P_i + 1 > P_i\). Therefore, \(P* > n\).

Proof by contradiction is a special case of the contrapositive. For example, to prove \(A\), is the same as proving \(True \Rightarrow A\), and the contrapositive is \(\neg A \Rightarrow False\).
