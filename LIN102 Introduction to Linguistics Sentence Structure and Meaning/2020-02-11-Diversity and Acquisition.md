# 2020-02-11 Language Diversity and Acquisition.

* Child language has much to do with acquistion.
* Consider the theory of generative grammar
  * built around capacity for human capacity for language
  * up until middle of 20thC, dominant view of language is like a habit
  * Chomsky says it's not possible, not complete enough to be based on picking up habits. Instead, it's a developmental one through a process of maturation; language organ.
  * Framework for investigating the problem for children seemingly effortlessly acquire language
    * Start with something built into it
      * we're limited from the starting properties of the "organ"
    * Evidence of uniformity across language
      * hierarchical structure
      * inventory of categories
    * Evidence of diversity across language. What does this tell us about the design?
    * tension between explaining uniformity, and explaining diversity
  * Tension resolved in theory of *principles and parameters*
    * Principles: aspects of language that are uniform across language, such as hierarchical structure
    * Parameters: aspects of language that can vary
      * Restricted choices? Or is it chaotic? Is there a finite set of choices?
      * Examples: Head first parameter
        * Consider the rule \(XP \to X YP\), where we can have XP rewritten as an X and a YP.
        * This can be seen as a principle: the complement of a head must be its sister.
        * But there is also room for parameterization: The complement can be on the left or right of the head
        ```
          XP
         /  \
        X   YP 
        ``` 
        ```
          XP
         /  \
        YP   X
        ```
        This captures the difference between SVO and SOV languages, because we model objects as the complements of Vs. At the same time we preserve the structural similarity between verbs and objects across languages.
    * Null subject parameter
      * Universally true that sentences must have subjects, but languages differ with respect to whether or not the subject must be lexically realized or not.
      * English: Julius Caesar was betrayed (cf. *was betrayed)
      * Italian: Ful tradito (Was-1st betrayed) '(I) was betrayed'
    * Human capacity for language boils down to humans being hardwired for the principles and paramaters that govern natural language. This is "Universal Grammar", what we're born with that allows us to acquire language.
    * Ultimate goal of generative grammar is to develop the correct characteristics of UG.
    * inextricably linked to understanding child language acquisition
      * What is the initial state of the language faculty?
      * What do infants already know? What do they have to figure out?
      * What evidence do children get from the language they get exposed to?
      * What kinds of mistakes do they make and why?
      * What kinds of mistakes do they not make?
  * L1 and L2 language acquisition are different.
    * Children acquire much of their grammar of their native language before five years old
    * Do this without being taught the rules of grammar by their parents.
    * When trying to correct rules of grammar, they're often ignored.
    * Child language is not 'bad' adult language. Children speak a version of the language that confirms to the set of grammatical rules they have developed at that stage of acquisition.
    * Children are not "making mistakes", but are working in a completely different grammar.
    * Can not assess child language on the production (just what they say) Comprehension is often ahead of production.
      * Children sensitive to words and word boundaries from about 10mo. First words appear 1-2 months later
      * Functional categories can be detected in 10-11 months old, even though such categories are missing from production until the second year.
  * You can present a baby with stimuli, and make observations such as gaze, comprehension if they can carry out instructions, brain patterns.
  * Proto-language behaviours 0-12 moths early communicating behaviours.
    * Recognizing mother's voice
    * Synchronizing eye gaze
    * Facial expressions with effect
    * Turn taking
  * Babbling 6-10 months
    * initially contains a wide repertory of speech sounds, but zeroes into speech sounds of the target language
    * At 8-10 months, adults can recognize the target language o a babbling child
    * **deaf children babble vocally as well**. We infer that inner biological clock governs onset of babbling.
    * babbling is not "crucial": children with tracheotomy surgeries that eliminates vocal production do not babble. When tracheotomy hole is closed, they quickly jump to age-appropriate behaviour, skipping various stages.
  * At 12-24 months
    * 1 word stage
      * figured out the concept of a word
      * strings of sounds systematically related to meaning
      * holophrastic stage: one-word utterances may convey more meaning
      * children know more language than they can express
    * 2 word stage
      * children start putting 2 words together, intonation contour extends over both words as a unit.
      * **telegraphic** utterances, omitting grammatical function words
        * short like a telegraph message
      * can convey a range of meaning
        * mommy sock - possessive
        * daddy here - subject
      * naming objects, stating ownership
      * learning about conversation
    * **Telegraphic stage** (2-2;6 years)
      * More complex sentences beyond 2 words, but still no function words like articles, pronouns, auxillaries.
    * 2-5 years
      * leave telegraphic stage and start uttering complex sentences
      * by 3, most children use function morphemes and produce complex synctatic function
      * after 3-6, children can use embedded CPs and question CPs
      * talk about remote events
      * by 4, the grammar is similar to a mature grammar
        * subtle but important differences such as complex embeddding.
    * Recap: Stages of production
      * **Babbling**
      * **1-word**
      * **2-word**
      * **Telegraphic**
      * **Adult-like**
    * Once children acquire about 50 words by 18 months, there is a vocabulary explosion: as many as 10-12 words a day and up to 20 words a day between 6 to 17.
      * A 6 year old has a 14 000 vocabulary
      * A 17 year old has about 60 000 
    * Learn words after a single exposure
    * signed languages:
      * deaf babies acquire signed languages in the same way
      * When deaf babies are not exposed, they create their own signs, complete with systematic rules
    * methodology
      * how do we assess word boundaries by babies? how do we observe this?
      * this process is underway by 6 or 7 months
    * Head turn preference paradigm
      * babies are faced with new sounds or images, they give attention to them differently than old or familiar sights or sounds
        * the baby's head swivels in the direction of a new stimulus. the longer the gaze the longer the attention
      * head turn preference paradigm
        * compares how long babies keep head turned towards different stimuli and interprets gaze as a measure of attention
          * familiarization phase: babies presented with stimuli becomes familiar
          * test phase: responses to familiar stimuli from familiarization phase are contrasted with new target stimuli
  * Use head-turn preference to determine word boundary
    * familiarization: babies head sentences that contains target words: eg bike, in different positions
      * His **bike** had big wheels
      * The girl rode her big **bike**
      * The bell on the **bike** was really loud.
    * Test phase: Baby presented with individual word as follows
      * flashing light turns on near the speaker the word will come from to get baby to turn his head
      * speaker repeats test word, and they measure how long for the baby to look away
      * compare baby's behaviour when a novel word not included in the familiarization phase was presented.
  * Verb Placement parameters
    * Background: finite verbs vs infinitives
    * In adult languages, main clauses must contain a tensed (or finite) verb.
    * a "main clause" has to be a tensed clause
    * uninflected clauses can only appear in subordinate clauses
    * > def'n **Inflection**
      > Inflection is a kind of bound morphology that is required by the grammatical function of the base it attaches to.
      > a. `Romeo love-s Juliet` 
      > b. `Romeo and Juliet love-*s each other`
    * Root infinitives in child language
      * Early child language does not have subordinate clauses!
      * Young children do use infinitives, in root clauses. These are referred as root infinitives
        * `Pas manger la poupee`
          `Not eat-inf. the doll`
          `The dog doesn't eat` 
    * This helps us understand "verb placement"
      * In the mini grammar of English, we have a specific position for verbs. 
      * Verb placement is a point of variation accross languages. Not all languages position their verbs in the same place. 
      * Consider english and french. the difference emerges when we consider a finer-grained set of patterns
        * a. `Romeo carefully words his letters`
        * b. `*Romeo soigneusement formule ses lettres`
        * c. `*Romeo words carefully his letters`
        * d. `Romeo formule soigneusement ses lettres`
      * Order of finite V and negation
        * a. `Romeo did not visit his neighbours`
        * b. `*Romeo ne pas visite ses voisins`
        * c. `*Romeo did visit not his neighbours`
        * d. `Romeo ne visite pas ses voisins`
      * In french, the verb moves to T and in pronounced in T.
        * V-to-T parameter
      * Since verb placement is a point of diversity, it is not hard-wired. Children need to figure out where finite verbs are placed in their language.
      * Infinitives in french behave differently: In a non-tensed clause, french stays like english.
      * `Romeo a l'habitude de ne pas visiter ses voisins`
        `Romeo NEG-v`... todo: add gloss for this
      * `Romeo ne visiter pas ses voises`
    * Early on, french speaking children are quick to correctly set the V-in-T parameter.
