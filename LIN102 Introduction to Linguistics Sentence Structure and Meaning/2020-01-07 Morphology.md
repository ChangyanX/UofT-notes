* Syntax takes individual words and combines them to form phrases that are grammatical
  * Not actually words, but for now assume a word atom
* Not all word combinations are grammatical
  * Require certain kinds of words, and words come in a certain arrangement
  * `*The cat the dog`, `*The chased a small` are not grammatical
    * Clearly not all words are the same
  * words fall into different syntactic categories ("parts of speech")
    * Noun
    * Verb
    * Adjective
    * Adverb
    * Preposition
    * Conjunction
    * Complementizer
    * Auxillary
    * Determiner
    * Degree
* How do we know what the categories are and which words belong to which category?
* Traditionally a category is determined by meaning. For example
  * **Nouns** describe persons, places, things
  * **Verbs** describes actions
  * This is not sufficient to describe categories.
    * **Betrayal** hurts -- an action
    * **Deforestation** is an environmental problem -- occurance
    * Steve can really take **a punch**
    * **It** is raining -- it doesn't refer to anything!
  * What about words like *that*, *of*, *for*?
* Semantic descriptions are not sufficient. Instead we determine categories by their distribution, i.e. where they can and can not appear.
* Distributional evidence is language specific
* For example, nouns in English follow determiners (the, a(n)) and adjectives.
  * the **betrayal**
  * the **deforestation**
  * the **collision**
  * a high **cost**
  * extensive **deforestation**
* words that do not appear in this position are not nouns
  * the **ate**
* In English, we have a criterion for adjectives: they appear between a determiner and a noun
  * the train
  * the blue train / *the train blue
  * *the blue
* In Spanish, this isn't true
  * el tren
  * *el azul tren/el tren azul
  * el azul
* Morphology refers to the forms of words
  * words are built from smaller atoms called morphemes 
    * hospital, hospitalize, hospitalized
    * baby, babysit, babysitter
    * establish, establishment, disestablishment, antidisestablishment, antidisestablishmentarianism
  * morphemes are the smallest meaningful units of language, but this means both semantically meaningful and indicating grammatical property.
  * For example, `dog` and `dog-s`, and `She read` and `She read-s`
    * The third person singular morpheme -s in English doesn't have semantic meaning but indicates agreement between the verb and its subject.
    * The plural morpheme -s indicates plurality, a semantic meaning
  * Morphemes are picky about what they attach to, and category is one of the properties they are sensitive to.
  * Nouns can have plural `-s` attached, but not prepositions and verbs. `*for-s`, for example.
    * If a word can be pluralized, then it is a noun. 
  * While only nouns can occur with `-s`, not all nouns. For example `furniture-s`. Plural `s` can only appear with **count nouns**. Nouns like `furniture` are **mass nouns** do not take the plural.
  * When applying diagnostic tests, we need to work with sets of results and be systematic about what inferences we make from them.
  * Other affixes pick out different categories
    * I dance
    * I danc -ed
    * I am danc -ing
  * In English, verb words can include bound morphemes that introduce aspect and tense. There are systematic exceptions, such as `*She is know-ing the answer` 
  * There are other `-ing` affixes that are not progressive. I.e. nomalizer `-ing`. `His reaching the top surprised me a lot`.
    * We need to be careful with ambiguous expressions. Two expressions with different meanings and functions can have the same form
