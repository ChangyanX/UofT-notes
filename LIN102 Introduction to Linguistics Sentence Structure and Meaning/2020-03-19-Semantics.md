* Semantics is the meaning of things
  * compositionality
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_turnstile
* the meaning of a sentence is determined by the meaning of its parts, and the way they are assembled
* Semantic relations
* Entailment
* \(s1\) *entails* \(s2\) in an universe if and only if \(s1\) is true, then \(s2\) is true.
  * \(s1 \implies s2\)
  * She is a student of linguistics
  * She is a very smart student of linguistics
* Asymmetric entailment, mutual entailment
  * paraphrase: same meaning expresed by different structure
  * synonymy: words have same meaning
* Contradiction: opposite of mutual entailment
  * A sentence can be internally contradictory.
    * The dog is not a dog
  * Any internally contradictory sentence \(s1\) entails any other sentence \(s2\)
    * cf. Vacuous truth
  * Tautology
    * A sentence that is necessarily true in every situation
    * A sentence \(s1\) is tautologically true, then any sentence \(s2\) entails \(s1\)
  * Presupposition
    * A sentence \(s1\) presupposes \(s2\) iff \(s1\) entails \(s2\), and the negation of \(s1\) entails \(s2\)
      * \(s1\) presupposes \(s2\) iff
        * \(s1 \implies s2 \wedge \neg s1 \implies s2\)
      * Julie regretted going to the dance
      * Julie didn't regret going to the dance
      * Julie went to the dance
    * belief or think has a lack of presupposition
