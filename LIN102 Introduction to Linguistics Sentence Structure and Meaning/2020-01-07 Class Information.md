* **Professor:** Susana Bejar



## Overview
* Linguistics
  * Scientific study for the **human capacity** for language
    * Map an infinite number of expressions to meaning
    * Assign meaning to a set of expressions
* Generative Grammar
  * pioneered by Noam Chomsky in 50s and 60s
  * problemitization of the capacity for language
  * at the time habit formation was the main theory for acquisition (behaviorism)
    * Pavlov's dog
  * Chomsky argued habit formation was not an appropriate metaphor. Instead, growth and maturation.
    * Biologically preprogrammed to acquire language
    * The system is too complex or habit
      * grammatical patterns, etc.
    * Faculty of language (language organ)
      * genetically determined initial cognitive state.
      * through experience we attain an adult grammar
      * **the capacity to map expressions to meaning is a cognitive capacity** and is fundamentally biological
      * Not *learning*, **acquisition**.
   * Procedure in grammar that allows us to map sound and meaning, and that procedure is syntax.

      Syntax -->
                \
                 > Semantics
     ```
  * Syntax is the input to both phonology and semantics and is the study of the mapping procedure itself
  * What are possible and impossible sentences in a language?   

* Branches
  * Phonology: Study of sound patterns in spoken language
  * Morphology: Study of word structure
  * Syntax: Study of sentence structure
  * Semantics: Study of meaning
* Methods
  * Linguistic theory
    * Study of grammar as a system of knowledge (atoms, combinatorial principles)
  * Psycholinguistics
    * study of language processing
  * Acquisition
    * study of how language is acquired
  * Sociolinguistics
    * study of how language use is affected

We will be studying linguistic theory, psycholinguistics and acquistion wrt syntax and morphology
