* Kurosawa's Rashomon is based on

* Point of View
  * Perception or conceptual position in terms of which the narrated situations and events are presented
  * organization and perspective
  * ex. Story of Otama and Okada (Wild Geese)
    * not provided in Otama's voice.
    * voice is different than point of view
  * Point of view can be defined temporally, spacially, ideologically
    * eg. Retrospective narrative (very old story)
      * temporally remote point of view
      * spacial point of view
      * ideological point of view
        * eg. a plumber talking about plumbing, could be a very professional pov, cf. with an average person
        * many varieties of point of view
  * **Polyphonic narrative**
    * also known as *dialogic narrative*
    * a narrative with multiple narrators
    * not just one voice or conciousness or worldview that prevails in the narrative
    * as opposed to monologic narrative
  * dancing girl was 1st person, for example

* **speech act**
  * utterance considered a goal-oriented act
  * includes written speech, something expressed by a use of words
  * a medium of expression
  * speech act is to do something by way of speech, about the goal or effect the speech creates
    * locutionary acts "act of producing a grammatical sentence"
      * factual statements,
    * illocutionary acts "performed *in* saying something to accomplish some purpose"
      * "i promise i'll buy flowers for you"
      * may or may not turn out to be true
    * perlocutionary act "performed by means of saying something, describable in terms of the effect on the addressee"
      * what sort of effect is created by the person who is listening?
      * perhaps you may be happy, troubled, etc. when someone says they are buying flowers. if that is focused on, then it is a perlocutionary act.
  * not as if one particulary speech is distinctly one. any one statement could be interpreted as many
  * for example, if you say something factual, but the addressee took it as criticism
    * intention is a locutionary act, but was taken as an illocutionary act
    * consider the opposite, if you wish to criticise someone, we can put it diplomatically so it comes across as a locutionary act
* We can classify speech acts another way
  * **constatives**
    * true or false statements that report events or states of affairs
    * simple, factual statements
  * **performatives**
    * utterances that do rather than say, to perform an act rather to state something is or is not the case.
* **a given utterance can be analysed differently with respect to different recipients**
  * hypothetically, there is always an audience for an utterance
* **unreliable narrator**
  * A narrator whose values (tastes, **judgments**, moral senses) diverge from those of the implied author
  * we are looking for a narrator that reveals their values, which seem to stand out
  * any narrative can not be neutral, always has a layer of judgments or values.
  * how the narrators values may stand out from the implied author
  * if we have embedded narratives, each embedded narrative provided by a different character
    * if that embedded narrator seems to reveal some taste or judgment
    * is this supposed to be the point of the narrative? or just someone's opinion
  * performance in narratology is a speech act
