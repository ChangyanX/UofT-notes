* how relations go to this point of strain
* One act completed in terms of the story of Suezo, Otsune, and Otama
* omniscient narrator
  * started out as narrator I
  * started with talking about his and friends life
  * begins to talk about Suezo, Otsune, Otama, that he did not participate in as a character
* Otama and Okada met up to chapter 18
* greet 
* taking a walk
  * literary person
  * someone who has lots of time, doesn't have to work
* rowing
* rowing, taking walks, are very western, priviledged habits.  
* when too cold to keep the window open 
  * people may thing is odd
  * tried to clean the front door to be able to see Okada


* chinese novels that Okada reads
  * Okada's meeting mirrors that story
  * Okada was reading Jinbinnmei
    * sexual desire
    * almost pornographic
    * all about sex

* addicted to some form of media
  * thinking of life events in terms of such media
  * narrator I predicts Okada's story as the jinpingmei (金瓶梅)
    * very exemplary femme fatale (poisonous woman)
    * eventually tries to kill her husband
    * other archetype is the tragic woman
      * even when she was gravely ill, she would be beautiful
      * opposite poles
      * Okada can not think of Otama in other terms
        * looks at her if she were a character in Chinese fiction
        * can not think of Otama in any other terms
        * can not do anything with her because he's a reader rather than a character 
          * keeps distance
          * look, judge (positively) her
          * describe and analyse her
          * would not partake with her, move in to her life and talk, listen to her.

* Okada develops his life story differently from typical chinese story
* narrator-I would also participate in the construction of Okada's life story
  * both are readers
  * discuss it, stay out of the story

* how the story is constructed
  * refers to its own narration
  * narrator-I comes back and interjects in his relation

* cf. kokoro
  * different strategic choice
  * both are first person
  * primary narrator I is a subordinate character
  * kokoro disturbs story time
    * narrative does not progress according to story time
    * ends with the oldest instance
      * sensei's life
    * towards the end, jumps back to the present
    * suspense
  * in *gan*, we are told of Otama's life before narrator-I knew of it in story time
  * story time is relatively preserved
  * parallel storylines until chapter 18
  * if this story proceeded as kokoro we would not know of Otama until the end of the story
  * narrator-I only knew that Otama would be Suezo's mistress
  * lose the effect of abruptness
  * need to feel Otama's pain

* curious to find out about Okada and Otama
  * would Okada save Otama from Suezo?
  * suspense
  * but nothing happens
  * anticlimactic

* homodiegetic narrator
  * observing from the side
  * imagining what would it be like to be Okada
    * jealously
    * what would it be like to be looked at by a woman like Okada
    * as narrator controls the narrative
    * Suezo believes that he can read Otama
    * Okada reads Otama as this idealised woman
    * narrator reads Otama
* otama
  * doesn't talk endlessly abou
  * has volition, privy to her psyche
  * binary opposition of male and female
  * everyone readin Otama, but Otama reading Okada

* there is more to it, but not telling you
  * invites us to speculate

## Conceptual
* interior monologue
* non mediated presentation of character's thoughts and impressions or perceptions
* long version of indirect thought
* free indirect thought < free indirect discourse
* no quote marks
* tense and pronouns same with narration
* not as the narrator would summarize or describe [the character's thought]
    * eg. narrator uses lots of fancy words
    * not the character's own thoughts, but how the narrator describes it
* description is not representation
  * description is how the narrator interprets the thoughts
* free indirect discourse
  * without quote marks
  * characters own thoguhts, not the narrator
  * can you bring it back to characters own words, and put it back into quotation marks

* so few interior monologues in kokoro vs wild geese?
  * kokoro characters are much more reserved
    * narrator i is not omniscient. when he doesn't know he says so
    * looks at others from outside
  * the wild geese
    * exploits privilege to have insight

* denoument
  * outcome or untying of the plot
  * expect somethings that becomes clear
  * messiness to tidiness
  * rising action - climax - falling action -denouement
  * 起承転結
    * origin
    * continuation
    * turn
    * conclusion
  * ex. sensei's testament
* causaity
    * relation of cause an effect
    * confusion between chronology and causality
    * what comes after x vs what is caused by x

* story time and discourse time reviewed
  * time in which things happen not necessarily time in which they occurred

* overt(intrusive narrator)
 * more than a minimum of narratorial medium
 * dramatized the storytelling
 * make the narrator's presence obvious
 * no clue from the perspective from which the story is told
