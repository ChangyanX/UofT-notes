# Introduction

* *discourse time*
  * duration of telling is different than the duration of things happening

* repeating narrative
* 31 stages of narrative
  
## What is narrative?
* Result, act or process of telling what has happened
* Story that has resulted (more static)
* Act or process (more dynamic)
* Narrative can be fiction or non-fiction.
  * describes what has happened in reality or in fiction
* Story + Discourse
  * Story is what is being told, or content (*fabula*)
  * Discourse is how the story is being told, or the form (*sjuzet*)
  
## How has narrative been studied (narratology)
Narratology is the study of narrative in scientific search of its law and grammar.

* Russian formalism (linguistics based study of folklore)
  * Vladimir Propp
* French structuralism
  * Gerard Genette
     * Marcel Proust (Remembrance of Time's Past)
  * Tzevetan Todorov
    * Arabian Nights

## Structure

* **Aristotle** characterized narrative as having a beginning, middle, and end
* **Propp**, in *Morphology of Folklore*, wrote that there were "31 Stages of Progression of a Story" or *31 Narratemes*
  * An *actant* is the role a character plays in the deep structure of the narrative.
    * Hero
    * Sought-after person
      * for example, love interest
    * Dispatcher
      * provides means to get to the person/object of interest
    * Helper
    * Villain
      * may be a rival, or simply attempt to spoil the plans of the hero
* **Genette**, in *Narrative Discourse: An Essay in Method*, identified the following elements.
  * Order
    * Chronological order in which events happen
    * Order in which events were told
    * Narratives are not always told chronologically, for example in detective fiction.
> Consider detective fiction, where interviews in the present, but the events of interest happened in the past relative to the narrator. We are presented in discourse time, and attempt to piece together the events in story time in our heads. For example, a few minutes in story time may be described in minute detail taking up several pages of discourse time, while years of story time may be covered in a paragraph or a line of discourse time.
  * Frequency
    * Story time (time in which events happen)
    * Discourse time (time in which the story is told)
  * Duration
  * Voice
    * Medium of the narrative
    * Intra-diegetic
      * The story is told from inside the story
      * Narrator is on site, experiencing the events as they are told.
      * Narrator is involved in the events, usually the character or protagonist
    * Extra-diegetic
      * The story is told from outside the story
      * Outside the story, for example, historians and storyteller, who is not involved and is simply retelling someone else's story
    * Hetero-diegetic
      * Different layers to the story
    * Homo-diegetic
      * Only one layer to the story
  * Mood
    * How distant the narrator is to the events
    * Focalization, point of view
    * How detailed the scene/events are described
    * Same thing may have happened and have been observed differently by different people/characters
* **Todorov** in *The Poetics of Prose*, wrote about...
  * Embedding
    * Stories within stories, narratives within narratives
    * Recursion ;)
  * Frame narrative
  
## Complication
* Mikhail Bakhtin
  * Dialogic narrative
    * Study of Dostoevsky
    * Different from monologue
      * Characters are talking to others, but no one is listening to what they are saying (besides the audience)
      * Talking exclusively to the audience
* Gerald Prince
  * Study of Narratee
    * If the audience is knowledgeable about the story, then you may tell the story differently
      * Skip details, or be more precise
    * Way the story is told depending on audience
* Linda Hutcheon 
  * Metanarrative/narcissistic narrative
    * The narrator is constantly talking about the narrative
    * Narrator is worried about how to tell stories
    * Self-referential narration
  * UofT alum :)

## Reinvention of Narratology

Narratology traditionally excluded what is outside the text, that is, narrative regardless of the authors position. Approaching these concepts necessarily involves the authors position.

* Postcolonial
