Consider this description that describes the `XOR` module.
```verilog
module xorgate(Y, A, B)
    input A, B;
    output Y;

    wire notA, notB, a1_o, a2_o;

    // no specific order
    // only describes the circuit

    not n1(notA, A);
    not n2(notB, B);

    and a1(a1_o, not A, B);
    and a2(a2_o, not B, A);

    or o1(Y, a1_o, a2_o);
endmodule
```

Most gates typically have one output, so the convention is to take the output first as an argument. This code above can be rewritten like so.

```verilog
module xorgate(Y, A, B);
    input A, B;
    output Y;

    // This is more descriptive.
    assign Y = ~A & B | A &~B;
endmodule
```

However, if we want to use the component, eventually we will need to use the first syntax to "assemble things from parts".

Consider the *range notation* syntax
```verilog
assign LEDR[9:0] = SW[9:0];
```
This is equivalent to 
```verilog
assign LEDR[9] = SW[9];
assign LEDR[8] = SW[8];
assign LEDR[7] = SW[7];
...
assign LEDR[0] = SW[0];
```
## FPGAs
- Field Programmable Gate Array
- Has a lot of logical blocks, and a bunch of wires connecting the blocks
  
## Multiplexer
- You have \(n\) inputs, and 1 output.

|A|B|C|D| |HEX[3]|
|-|-|-|-|-|--|
|0|0|0|0|*0*|1|
|0|0|0|1|*1*|0
|0|0|1|0|*2*|1|
|0|0|1|1|*3*| |
|0|0|

But since HEX segments turn on when their input signal is **LOW**, we need to reverse the outputs.
