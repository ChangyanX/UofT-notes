# ALU

The ALU performs all arithmetic operations


```
          A B
          | |
          V V
        +-----+
C_in -> | ALU | -> VCNZ
        +-----+
           |
           V
           G
```

VCNZ: Overflow, carry out, negative, zero-condition.

What can we do to one of the inputs to do functionality such as incr, decr, etc.

If the input logic on the left sends B straight to the logic, result is `G = A + B`


|S1|S0|Y|Op Cin = 0|Op Cin = 1|
|--|--|-|-|--|--|
|0 |0 |All 0s| G = A (transfer)| G = A + 1 (incr)|
|0 | 1|B|G = A + B|G = A+ B + 1|
| 1|0|~B|G = A + ~B|G + A + ~B + 1 (subtract)|
|1 | 1|All 1s|G = A - 1 (decr)|G = A (transfer)|

How do we implement multiplication?

Notice that 

```
   123  <=>  123   +   123   +    123
*  456      *  6      * 50      * 400
------      ----      ----      -----
```

In binary

```

   101 <=>  101   +  101  +   101
 * 110     *  0     * 1-    * 1--
 -----     ----     ----    -----
            000     1010    10100 = 000 & 1010 & 10100 = 11100
```


We basically AND together several adders. Since none of these have a clock, the order of this operation is O(1). However, this has O(n^2) size if we have a matrix mutiplier circuit

## Accumulator circuits
* If we only have one row of adders, we can have a circuit that takes O(n) and (n) 
* Keep shifting bits from the register, and AND with the other operand.

### Booth's Algorithm
* Takes advantage of circuits where shifting is cheaper than adding, or space is premium

```
eg. 12345 * 10000 = 12345 0000
    12345 * 1     = 12345
    12345 * 9999  = 12345 * 10000 - 12345 * 1 = 123437655
```

Consider the equivalent in binary
```
X * 001111 = X*010000 - X*1
```

We can understand the data, and come up with intuitions.
Triggered on cases where two neighboring digits in an operand are different.

* If digits at `i` and `i - 1` are 0 and 1, the multiplicand is added to the result at position `i`


We basically subtract a component where the first
<!-- 
if 0 and 1, add
if 1 to 0, subtract -->
<!-- 
Wherever we have a stretch of 0s in A turn into 1, add B at that position. When we have a stretch of 1s in A turn into 0, subtract B. -->

0 -> 1 subtract
1 -> 0 add

How can we make this work?
* We can't scan
* What if we have a shifter, and with 2 bits in place
* If any bits are one and zero, or zero and one, do the proper steps
