## Electricty
Electrical particles want to flow from regions of high electrical potential (many electrons) to low electric potential (fewer electrons)

* The potential is called *voltage* (\(V\))
* The rate of electron flow is *current* (\(I\))

* The relationship between voltage and current is resistance \(R = \frac{V}{I}\)
  
Convention is to measure current as movement of positive charges, even though electrons are negative.

Electric particles are trying to flow towards a neutral source &mdash; ground. Electricity takes the path of least resistance, from source to ground. 

**Insulators** don't conduct electricity at all, **conductors** conduct electricity well. Resistance is measured in Ohms \(\Omega\).

A **semiconductor** have properties of both insulators and conductors, and are made of silicon, or germanium, depending on factors such as temperature and impurities.

**Silicon** should have 8 electrons in their valence shell, but only have 4. Forming a lattice with its neighbours it can fill up the spaces in their valence shell. It does not conduct electricity naturally, but we can introduce impurities, called **doping**

  * *n-type* Group 15, with 5 electrons in its valence layer (e.g. Phosphorus, arsenic)
    * Charge **carriers** in *n-type* semiconductors are free electrons, so they can flow more freely through the material.
  * *p-type* Group 13, which have 3 electrons in its valence layer (e.g. Boron)
    * The **carriers** of free charge in *p-type* semiconductors are caled **holes**, to represent the electron gap that results from the imbalance of free elecrons.

When you bring *p-type* material in contact with *n-type* material, the electrons at the surface of the *n-type* material are drawn to the holes of the *p-type*. The area where the two areas meet become neutral and is called a **depletion layer**. The doping atoms that remain creates an **electric field** in the region. 

One field will be more positive (*p-type*), and one will be more negative (*n-type*), then electron will be pushed towards the positive field. Current caused by the field is called *drift*, and current caused by the hole is called **diffusion**
