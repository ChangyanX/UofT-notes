If \(X_n\) are all the inputs of size \(n\), then define \(T(n)\) 

\[
 T(n) = \max \{ t(n) : x \in X_n\}
\]

Then 

\[
T(n) \in \mathcal{O}(g(n)) \iff \exists c, n_0 > 0. \forall n \geq n_0. T(n) \leq cg(n)
\]

\[
T(n) \in \Omega(g(n)) \iff \exists c, n_0 > 0. \forall n \geq n_0. T(n) \geq cg(n)
\]

When we are looking for a lower bound, we need to find an input that takes at least \(g(n)\) steps.

\[
\exists x \in X_n, \text{the algorithm takes at least } cg(n) \text{ steps}.
\]

For example, if we have \(f(n) = 3n^2 + 2n + 1\), then we can show \(a n^2 \leq f(n) \leq b n^2\) to show that \(f(n) \in \Theta(n^2)\), for some constants \(a\) and \(b\). In this case, we can clearly see \(a = 3, b = 4\) this statement holds.
