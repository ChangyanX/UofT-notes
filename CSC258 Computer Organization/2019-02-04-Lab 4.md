# Lab 4

## Question 1
Given a clocked SR latch, what are the values from Q and Q', given the following inputs on S, R, and C, in that order.

|S|R|C|Q|Q'|Reason|
|-|-|-|-|--|------|
|0|0|1|X|X |Indeterminate|
|1|0|1|1|0 |`SET` with `CLK` high|
|1|0|0|1|0 |`CLK` low|
|0|0|0|1|0 |`CLK` low|
|0|1|0|1|0 |`CLK` low|
|0|1|1|0|1 |`RESET` with `CLK` high|

When SET is on, the output goes high. When RESET is on, the output goes low. When SET and RESET are both low, **nothing happens**. The value is **indeterminate** if it has no previous value.

## Question 2
What will be the outputs of QL and QF?

```
         +-------+
D ----+--+ DL  QL+--QL
      |  |       |
      |  |    QL'+---QL'
C--+-----+ C     +
   |  |  +-------+
   |  |  +-------+
   |  +--+ D   QF+--QF
   |     |       |
   +-----+>C  QF'+--QF'
         +-------+

```

```
C  _---___----__
D  _-_--_-_--_-_
QL _-_----_--_
QF _-------_____
```


**Arrow on the click means flipflop**

QL: It should look exactly like D when C is high.
QF: Matches D on each clock edge.
