# Lab 5 
1. Make a counter
2. Make the counter work with the clock
3. Morse code.

## Assignment

* Combinational circuits uses blocking assignments `=`.
* Sequential circuits use non-blocking assignemnts `<=`.
* Don't mix assignment types in the same always block.

## Part 2

* Main goal:
  * display hex number at different speeds
  * make the number change every second
  * need access to a clock signal
    * `CLOCK_50`, the 50 stands for 50MHz
      * 50 million times a second
    * need to turn the 50MHz signal into a 1Hz signal
    * counter for 50 million
  
``` verilog
reg [3:0] q;
always @(posedge clock)
begin
  if (~clear_b)
     q <= 0;
  else
    q = q+1;
end
```

This is a 4 bit counter.


* You need to load the clock, increment. If q is ever 50 million (or some input), reset the counter, and make the output high.

## Morse Code

* mux for a bunch of letters from `S` to `Z
* dot = 0.5s ON
* dash = 0.5 * 3 ON
* pause 0.5s OFF

1. create a LUT
   * gets the 3 switch values that determines the letter
   * outputs the relevant morse code signal, for each flash


```
               +---+
--Letter [3]-->|LUT|
               +-+-+
                 |
            Sequence [7]
                 |
           +-----+--------+
CLOCK_50   |Shift Register|
           +--------------+
            
```

Each bit corresponds to 0.5 seconds of display
