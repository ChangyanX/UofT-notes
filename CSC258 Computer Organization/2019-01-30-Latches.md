# Latches

Assume \(S' = 1, R' = 0\).
```
       +------+
       |      |
S' -+--+ NAND +---+->Q
    |  |      |   |
    |  +------+   |
    +-----------+ |
                | |
       +------+ | |
       |      | | +----+

    |  |      |        |
    |  +------+        |
    +------------------+
```

\(R'\) sets \(Q'\) to 1, setting \(Q\) to 0.
* Setting \(R'\) to 1 keeps output \(Q'\) to 1, which maintains both outputs (doesn't change the output). The output from the top NAND gate forces the bottom (\(Q'\)) to 1.
  
* Setting \(S'\) to 0 (after \(R'\) is set to 1) will force the bottom to 0 (since the output Q will become 1). Setting \(S'\) back to 1 keeps \(Q'\) at 0, and nothing changes.
* Inputs of `11` maintain the previous output state.

|S'|R'|Q|Q'|Q+1|Q'+1|State|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|0|0|x|x|1|1|INVALID|
|0|1|x|x|1|0|SET|
|1|0|x|x|0|1|RESET|
|1|1|0|1|0|1|PERSIST|
|1|1|1|0|1|0|PERSIST|

* Going from 00 to 11 produces unstable behavior (switching both at the same time)
* The circuit remembers its signal when going from 01 or 10 to 11.


Note that NAND with 0 is 1.

* Set and Reset
* S goes high to store a value of 1.
* R goes high to reset the value.
  
Note that signals don't change instantaenously

SR Latch
Note that in this case, circuit state is kept going from 10 or 01 to 00.

|S|R|Q|Q'|Q+1|Q'+1|State|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|0|0|0|0|0|1|PERSIST|
|0|0|1|0|1|0|PERSIST|
|0|1|x|x|0|1|RESET|
|1|0|x|x|1|0|SET|
|1|1|x|x|0|0|INVALID|


* Unstable behavior occurs with S'R' latch goes from 00 to 11, or an SR latch goes from 11 to 00.

* 00 is considered a forbidden state in NAND S'R' latches, and 11 forbitten in NOR SR latches.

## Timing

One Hz = 1 time per second

```
Reset _-_-___--
Set   __-_---__
Q     __-_---__
```
Hence we get the value 01011100 (one _ or - is an interval)
We need some sort of timing signal to let the circuit know when the output may be sampled.

```
Clock _-_-_-_-_-_
```

It is produced externally to maintain some signal that is going at the speed of the signal; smallest unit of time.


## Clocked SR latch

Adding another layer of NAND gates to the \(S'R'\) latch gives a clocked \(SR\) latch

Essentially the effect is that the latch only changes from the inputs, if the clock is on. Otherwise, Q is not changed.

|C|S|R|Q+1|Result|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|0|X|X|Q|NC|
|1|0|0|Q|NC|
|1|0|1|0|R|
|1|1|0|1|S|
|1|1|1|1|?|Undefined|

D latch


|Q|D|Q+1|
|-|-|-|
|0|0|0|
|0|1|1|
|1|0|0|
|1|1|1|


If you put R and S dependent on a single signal D, you can avoid the indeterminate state. D then sets Q low or high whenever C is high.

```

## Timing issues

Consider the circuit

```

+---------------+
|     +----+    |
+-NOT-|D   |-Q--+---
     -|C   |
      |    |-Q'-----
      +----+
```

```
C _-------____
Q _-_-_-_-____
```
As long as the clock is high, the output is allowed to flipflop between 0 and 1.

We want to be able to make the output change **exactly** when the clock changes, not flip flop while the clock is opening.
