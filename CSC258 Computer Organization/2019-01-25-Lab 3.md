# Verilog

* More Verilog syntax
* Implement full adder circuits
* Hierarchal design


## `case`

* express logic beyond the gate-by-gate spec
  * usually in an `always` block.

* `case` statements provide output for all possible values.
  * selects for an output based on a select signal
    * essentially creates a multiplexer
    

## `always(condition)`
* whenever `condition` is true, then do the following.
* for now, `condition = *`, so the case will always be expressed.

## Part 1
* Use `case` and `always` to implement a 7-1 multiplexer
  * Remember to use the default statement
  * use `reg` within always blocks instead of `wire`

## Part 2
* Implement a ripple carry adder by chaining 4 full-adders
* `module full_adder(C, S, A, B, Cin)` supplied
  
```verilog
module four_bit_adder(S, C, A, B, Cin)
    full_adder fa1(K, ..., );
    full_adder fa2(L, ..., K);
    full_adder fa3(M, ..., L);
    full_adder fa4( , ..., M);
endmodule
```
Need to wire up the full adders.

# Bitwise Operators

If you use a bitwise operator with two `n-bit` operators, the result is also an `n-bit` vector.

Bitwise AND

```
  1010
& 0011
------
  0010
```

Bitwise OR
```
  1010
| 0011
------
  1011
```

# Reduction Operators

* Take a single multi-bit operand, and result in a single bit vector.
* 1101 AND will give you 0, OR will result 1.
