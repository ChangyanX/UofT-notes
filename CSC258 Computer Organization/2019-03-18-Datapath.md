Given `add $t7, $t1, $t2`, can we operate the datapath?

1. Figure out the data source
2. Determine the path of the data
3. Deduce the signal values that cause this path
   1. Start with Read and Write (only one can be high at time)
   2. Mux the signals
   3. Non essential values get an `X` value

Step
1. Data source and destination
   1. Data starts in the register block
      1. A and B will be `$t1` and `$t2` **read addr**
   2. Data goes to the regsiter block
      1. `$t7` will end up in the **write addr**
2. Data needs to go through the ALU before heading back into the register file.
   1. Old read values **must be held at the entrance of the ALU** 
3. Read and Write Signals
   1. Which ones are on?
   2. RegWrite needs to be set high. All the other signals low.
4. Data path signals
   1. ALUSourceA = 1 Since we're taking in 2 registers
   2. ALUSourceB = 0
   3. ALUOp = 001
   4. Mux before registers = MemToReg = 0
5. Non-essential signals
   1. Not writing to PC: PCSource = X
   2. Not reading from memory: IorD = X
6. RegDst: Where is the register going to?
   1. High for 3-register ops
   2. Low for 2-register ops

We can do an additional exercise.

How can we add 100 to the program counter?

1. Data source and dest
   1. Source 
      1. PC
      2. Instruction
   2. Destination 
      1. PC
2. Path between source and destination
3. Signals

What are the following assembly instructions doing?

* `sub $t7, $t0, $t1`
* `andi $t7, $10, 15`
* `sra $t2, $t1, 2`
