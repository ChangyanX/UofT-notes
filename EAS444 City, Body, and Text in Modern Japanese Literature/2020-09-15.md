* Most texts originally written in Modern Japanese, 2 in Classical Japanese
* Modern Japanese meant to be accessible to the general population
* **City**:
  * Urban Space
  * many people gather, and are strangers to each other
  * constantly changing
  * coming in and leaving, moving around within the city
  * characterizes the city as a space
  * map is usually seen in a birds eye point of view
    * not usually the way the city is experienced by humans
    * use various forms of transportation
    * walk around
  * experiencing the city is very different from the knowledge we form by looking at the city
    * maps presume the omniscient position of knowing the city
  * see how human beings experience the city from a not so privileged position
  * move around, getting to know the city
  * try to figure out as we go by
  * human experience of the city
  * always feel like you don't know enough
  * what's next?
  * knowing the city vs experience the city
    * knowing: via maps or historical documents
    * experience: bodily exploration
  * kinetic - experience of going from place to place
    * walking down the stairs
    * getting on the platform
    * cycling around
      * how the bike moves
      * good order bike or not
  * may not be always aware of the reading experience of the city narratives
* **Body**:
  * people are moving around
  * animal body
  * plant bodies
  * exteriority of human being
  * how we move, use the body
  * how we explore the city with the body
  * interiority
    * values
    * personality
    * thoughts
    * mind
    * why is interiority considered more important?
  * should not be clearly divided between exteriority and interiority
  * mind is part of the body, and body is under control of the mind
  * city as space, and body that navigates the city
  * functions, sensations of the body
    * sight
    * smell
    * sound
    * touch
    * taste
  * modernity => overwhelming prioritization of vision
    * modern society considered to be spectacle based
    * colonizing/objectifying who they see
    * power of vision, gaze
  * pay attention to other features of the body
  * process other sensations
  * restore the entirety of the human faculty
  * explore, experience the city
  * city is not an obvious entity
  * space and the body is mutually effective
  * smell of food, restaurants
  * feel the temperature
  * not allowed to touch each other very casually right now unfortunately
  * human body not so colonizing
  * sound/smell/touch
  * vulnerable, susceptible to others
* **text**
  * explore city and body as represented in text
  * explore new media
  * sort of separated by the experience of the body, but also connected
  * we can not register the sensation through text
  * text is a medium that remains important, but it is not transparent transfer of an experience
  * modern japanese tends to assume transparency
    * what we experience can be transcribed in words
    * if a word means something to somebody it should mean the same thing to another person
    * _more tricky than that_
    * have to fortify and acquire skills
    * what it means, how it is constructed, what sort of layers are projected into the text
  * in literature, there are complications of subjectivity
    * who is observing what, from where, how they are observing, and why
    * different layers
      * observer
      * narrator
      * temporality complications in literature
        * concurrent, simultaneous narration of events
        * retrospectively presented with advantage of knowledge
        * anticipated
        * what happens is slowly described in detail or quickly summarized
