## Review of introduction
* panorama city
  * maeda ai
* synecdoche
  * applied to the way the city is understood
  * part is made to represent the whole
* asyndeton
* administration
  * the way the city is handled and designed
  * the "enemy" of walking
  * Unify understanding of city without regard to incidental
* walking
  * bottom up concept, not top down
* connect linguistic concepts to urban space
* Literary turn into geography, spatial turn in literary studies
* What makes a city a city?
  * structure, but also movement
  * design, but also experience
  * Design is done by administration
    * Ideal of how to control and construct the city
    * Top-down discourse of the city
  * acts, behaviour, gestures
    * Acts: go to restaurants, theatres, commit crimes, etc.
      * consciously thought about
    * Behaviour: attend school, go to job, routine; the mundane
      * May be conscious, but not intentional in the way acts are
    * Gestures: hand gestures
      * Send messages to others
      * phyical, visible, manual
      * illustrate human experience of the city
* Exteriority vs Interiority
  * City vs Body
  * Body vs Mind
  * exteriority more about urban space
  * interiority more about the mind
    * emotions, feelings, ideas
  * Characters feelings are more interiority
  * How exteriorities affect interiority
  * Is body subordinate; servant to the mind?
    * Mind is part of the body
    * Affected by the bodily experienc
* What does literary text do in this?
  * Not to translate experience into words
  * Not only the content (what), but also the form (how), and the rationale for the form (why)
* Intersection of narrative and space discussed together.
* Narrative time:
  * Toyotarou is writing about Berlin
  * Writing a story about going to Berlin, living in Berlin, and returning from Berlin
  * Narrator currently in Saigon
* maps vs itinerary
  * maps are birds-eye view: omniscient view
    * more static
    * more spatially oriented
    * instantaneous
  * itinerary are more tangible, going from one point to another
    * more dynamic
    * more temporally oriented
    * gradual
    * more humble, more fearful
* text not as transparent representation of city and body
  * describing experience of the city to the reader
* don't get carried away by the content
  * focus on form: how the content is presented, and why it is so
  * how he translated experience of city into words

## de Certeau
* walking is a quite mundane activity
  * people who can not walk, otherwise have some mobility issues
* curtailed walking due to covid-19
* even though mundane worthy of theorization
* cautions us about theorization
  * less experience oriented, actualization
  * more top-down
* experience is done by mind
* de Certeau is a narrative grammarian
* Memories of other cities layered
  * new york (world trade centre)
    * semi birds eye view
    * ironic lol    
* background in paris
  * echoes of other cities
* verticality and horizontality
  * see repercussion of this in maihime
  * verticality is not complete
  * wherefrom is the view commanded?
* pedestrians on the street
* panopticon: authority vs citizens
  * one sided ness of the gaze, power and control
  * experienced vs administered space
## Benjamin
* more of a literary scholar

* archival studies are done by mind
* cites from a lot of literary sources
* very fond of the arcade

* tries to bring in the grammar of the narrative of the city
* narrative of the city
* classifies things
* talks about edgar allan poe's depiction of london
* autobiographical knowledge of berlin
* crowd vs flaneur
  * flaneur absorbs the crowd gets lost in the crowd
  * sort of privilege of the flaneur
  * crowd is doing things in the  city with purpose
  * flaneur is drafting aimlessly, getting intoxicated in the crowd
## Cities
* how to complicate the normative view of the city?
  * normative view is the view of the city by administration
    * city must have x function placed here and there
    * define, locate, make things work
    * want places to stick to their function to fulfill the potential
    * function and definition oriented
    * timeless quality
  * alternative view
    * what people do in the city
    * what they smell in the city
    * what they hear in the city
    * the experience of being in the city
    * how they get distracted
    * what people do in the city
    * movement makes the relationship between places and the body
  * tools, animals, things in the city
  * toyotaro dazzled by the things
* refocus on material details of the text
## Dancing Girl
* space-text interface
* often read as a bildungsroman, 
  * not a bildungsroman or a story of the evolution of interiority of the modern subject
  * but as a city experience by a body in flux and remembered recounted in distinct spacetime
* written in Saigon but already as a perspective from which to reasses experience in berlin, both temporal and spacial distance
* Materiality vs corporeality
  * how the body moves on foot, on transportation
  * how the body moves in various public spaces
  * things people touch, use, sense
  * how body moves
    * public transport
    * walking
    * in spaces
      * cafes
        * toyotaro wrote articles in cafe? why?
          * people in cafe were quite old
          * newspapers hung on walls there
          * print media
          * not to socialize, but to observe strangers
          * flaneur
          * pay attention to things, physical activities
      * streets
  * soldiers and young girls walking in unter den linden
    * won a war against france (supeior to france?)
    * girls still wearing parisian styles
* Toyotaro moves from the big open public space into Elise' small attic: private space
  * pay more attention to things
    * books, lamp, body of father, small stove, furniture
    * narrative via things
    * very poor, but have certain things
    * petite bourgeois lifestyle
      * is it a facade?
      * maeda ai thinks it is a form of seduction
      * not just filling the space, but part of narrative formation
    * are they the crowd? crowd is imagined in the public space.
  * panorama of Berlin, cf. diorama of Elise' room
  * ubiquitous nature of visual devices
    * space full of images
    * panorama is a place that people go to to experience visual media
    * big display of pictures
    * panorama is a big picture that people walk along to view
      * impossible picture
      * temporal and spatial extension
    * diorama is a small screen that depicts the scene 
      * smaller size
      * intimate
      * diorama screen moves
    * interior space -- diorama, public space -- panorama
* modern urban space: heterogenous, invested with diverse trajectories of arriving populace, smooth.
  * not the only stranger in berlin
  * ethnically complex
  * city changes constantly
* modern nation-state: homogeneity sought, territorially oriented, autonomy imagined, striated.
  * constant
  * homeostasis
  * conflict/contrast of nation vs city
* national language is shared
  * linguistic identity is complicated
  * german, french, japanese spoken in maihime
  * nationality (citizenship) measured by nativity of language
  * native fluency vs acquired language (owning, being owned by native language)
    * translation, identity transformed but not invalidated
  * toyotaro was the most fluent french speaker?
    * german and french are acquired languages
    * crucial in determining what, who he is.
    * toyotaro teaches Elise "proper" German
      * Elise spoke a regional dialect of German
        * "accent" is mentioned
      * toyotaro would have been taught hochdeutsch
      * bring regional culture into national culture
      * "normative" german
      * foreigner for whom German was acquired would teach the German native "proper" language
  * French vs German vs Russian
  * bungo* vs *kanbun* vs *gabun*
  * 伯林 vs ベルリン
* Toyotaro arrives in berlin, and take in all the stimulus
  * semi-birds eye view juxtaposed with 3 dimentional illustion in images with vanishing point
  * emporer makes appearance on terrace to command view of new apartment building
  * Toyotaro does not take the view like the emporer does, view is imagined
  * authorative gaze replaced with that of the pedestrian walking in a narrow street, congested, hard to see
  * top down view vs ground up view
  * towards the end Toyotaro walks around the city dazed
  * a lot of people in cafe but so absorbed
* walker in order to get lost in his interiority
