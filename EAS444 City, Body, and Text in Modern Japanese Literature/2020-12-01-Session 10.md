# 2020-12-01 Session 10

* different ways of thinking about nationalism
  * view it in terms of the city
  * unlike the nation, in the city heterogeneity is the key
    * city is heterogeneous by default
    * people in the city form new social relations through practices that open on the ground
    * such relation are viewed by the authorities, but can also go beneath the view
  * nation is an abstract concept to imagine homogenous community
  * good way to return to spatial practices
    * spatial practices difference from administrative design
    * resistance and negotiation, surrender to design
    * very sensationally oriented
* language is still language without comprehension 
  * can still appreciate the sound of language without comprehension
* cats in colonial modern landscape
  * in literature, show specific function
  * loss of life -- island of dead cats and rats
    * in shanghai
    * same fate of loss of belonging shared with animal
* how animals share the streets with humans even though they don't belong to the same place
* (stray/dead) cats represent the loss of place
* black cats associated with experience of europe
  * nagai kafuu's black cat is objectified and without agency
* imagine animal subjectivity
* reflecting on the anthropocene

* when we say 'body' we have self-implied the human body
  * only time we have complicate this was when we discussed children
* homeless people, criminals
* how trees, as well as humans have suffered disasters but not animals
* are animals subaltern subjects?
  * start from relations, and define subjectivity
    * because you become a friend of someone, your subjectivity changes
  * relations define who you are as a subject
  * thinking about subjectivity as relationality across species
  * owning a pet changes your subjectvity   
  * not just domesticated animals, might go to zoos, aquariums
  * can also be inanimate, attachment to things
  * can be physical, non physical
  * all sorts of relationships can be thought as formative about subjectivities
* posthumanism
  * how do we move beyond anthropocentrism?
  * how might we think the human otherwise?
* identity
  * age, gender, cultural background
  * subjectivity is different, it is define through action, including thought
  * subjectivity is fluid, contingent on circumstances and activities
    * identity does not define the action, but action defines subjectivity
* become an animal
  * in human liberalism, human identity is very important
  * move on from that and think about how we become animal
  * does not mean pretending to be an animal/disguise of an animal
  * if you spend time with animals, it makes you more animallike and become closer to animals
* ethical relationship
  * humans often peak for animal, think for the animal
  * but humans are not the animals, take away the right to name and categorize the world from humans including animals
  * naming is a violent act of domination, an essential issue, exhibition of power
  * humans are now forced or enticed to listen to animals
    * respond, observe and become attuned to nature, incl. animals
* city is very artificial
  * design and administrated by humans in human terms
  * animals did not participate in design and administration
    * have to accept human terms to some extent
* if you are a pet, mostly confined to a human space at the mercy of a human
  * cat was a stray but confined within the teacher's house
  * kanai's tama was scratching the glass, confined to the house
* degree of freedom confined to the humans
  * need to negotiate with human or accept their terms
  * rules often imposed by humans on the animals
  * many cases where animals negotiate, take advantage of humans who want to have animals on their lives
    * demand more power and freedom in the human space
* size matters in relation to space
  * small animals vs big animals
  * small animals may go into more narrow spaces but not occupy bigger spaces
* talking to cat
  * cat is always yelled at in i am a cat
    * cat seems to understand human speech but humans do not understand cat
    * cat can read teacher's journal
    * narrated by the cat

    * tama does not have narrative power
    * natsuyuki a more listening perspective
* domesticated cats more used to confinement
* cat becomes subject of the human owner
* each subdivision is designed for the purpose of something
* much more smooth than humans, nature to strol without thinking what others might be thinking
* cats as flaneurs
  * stray cat narratives
