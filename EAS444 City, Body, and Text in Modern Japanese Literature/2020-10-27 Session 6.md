* spectacle/spectator

* Female flaneur -- flaneuse has connotations of prostitution
* Flaneur was originally strictly male, middle class wanderers with privilege to do so
* even if dancing girls provide spectacle both are 3 dimensional beings
  * can have interaction with them
* compare with images on screen, which are fundamentally a visual relationship,
  * cannot touch 2d
  * touch complicates pickford/naomi chaplin/protag relationship
* When naomi encourages her to imitate pickford, only the visual sense

  * taken advantage of those that are fluent in the ways of the city
    * those that have capital to take advantage of
  * because of multitudes there is fear of unrest from police
    * heterogeneity is somewhat in opposition to 'harmony'
  * 1930s, communists and police in Japan
* fingerprints, surveillance systems to pin down individuals
  * scientific, biopolitical
  * most strategic weapon
  * surveillance can be humanly done (i.e patrol), or machines (camera)

  * description of kuniko's fat during the butchering of her body
  * reminders of criminal acts, fats, fingers,

  * without such description, effect would be much more minimized
  * not just peripheral descriptions
  * how brain reacts to rest of the body and vice versa
  * choreography of actions
* try to restore awareness of other senses through text
* in visual sense, subject is always autonomous of the object
  * whereas there is no distance in tactile sensation
  * when touching the object, you are being touched by the object
    * reciprocal
