# 2020-09-29 Session 2
* Division between interior and exterior is not so clear
  * Who is to blur the distinction better than the flaneur?
  * man of the crowd, would share the space with the crowd, however, he is not a member of the crowd
  * he walks without purpose 
  * public space becomes an extension of the interior
  * position to complicate the distinction between interior and exterior space
  * exterior is obvious but why is it interior
    * eg. toyotaro goes to the cafe and observes, but does not engage with the crowd
    * lost in his own mind
    * to write in a public space
  * some people prefer to be in a home office, some people prefer a public space to do work
  * cafe is an ambiguous space
* toyotaro walking around the neue berlin
  * when he walks around, he is wandering without purpose
  * division between interior and exterior space are confused
* to note where the writing is done, vs events being written about
  * toyotaro writing in the ship
  * not a diary
  * temporal and spatial distance
  * bitterly remembering what happened
* Pedestrian street acts complicate the place, and turn it into a space
  * complicate the city planner's administration view
* Don't overextend the crowd
  * not just many people, but also strangers
  * don't have names and spaces
  * anonymous
* panoramic space
  * wide, broad range of view
* linear view/visual scope
  * limited can not see very well
  * vulnerable
  * gaze, light
* Metropolis and Mental Life - seminal text in sociology
  * aural, visual exchnages between strangers in intracity public transport
  * seeing without hearing is much more uneasy than someone who hears without seeing
  * people had never been in situations where they had to look at one another for long minutes or hours without speaking to one another
* we feel scared when a stranger approaches us in transit
  * normative action is to not speak to each other
* gaze without looking
  * sanshiro staring at the lady on the train
  * sanshiro looking at the two ladies on campus
  * looking at Bacon to avoid man's gaze
* conversation between sanshiro and the nameless man "hirota"
  * had time at hand, both going to tokyo
  * time is limited, hesitation to talk
* intracity mundane
* public transportation
  * defined by way of purposes
  * a train is an extraordinary bundle of relation
    * something which one passes
    * something by means of which one can go from one point to another
    * something that passes by
      * when sanshiro first arrives in tokyo he is passed by the streetcars
      * hearing the noise that the streetcars create
      * nonomiya says: it is so noisy, its supposed to be more convenient but more confused
        * experience as a passenger
        * at the moment they were just watching them pass by
    * not just a means to move from point a to b, but as a spacetime itself to be experienced
      * crowded space: not just for you, more or less immobile bodies in a mobile machine moving at speed
        * shared with people and things that are on the move themselves
        * no one "belongs" there
      * compartments, seats, corridors, windows
      * sharing food, life stories, **not names**
* lunch box episode
  * didn't expect the lunchbox to hit the woman
  * sanshiro himself is not moving, but the train is moving
  * what he threw out the window will be caught into the next row
  * neglect of the speed at which the vehicle is moving
  * if you are walking on foot, then you never forget that you are moving
  * knowing names turns a member of a crowd into an individual
    * explicitly said that sanshiro never learns his name 
    * "bunch of people like him in tokyo"
    * he later finds him in tokyo and learns his name
* literature is not the same as plot summary
  * can not simply reduce literary works to their plot summary
  * tonality of the text, nothing is irrelevant or trivial
  * author must deliberately write about every function 
* depending on where sanshiro is seated his scope of vision changes
  * determines the physical dynamics of who he meets
  * icebreaker, peaches, something to draw attension
* life stories
  * woman talking to the old man
    * while sanshiro was looking at the woman's face
    * man and woman were strangers
* trains exterior to home, but interior from the outside landscape/world
* train, like cafe, is an ambiguous space
* old sleeping man got off the train without saying a word
  * episode included because author thought it was important
  * why was it important?
    * temporary fleeting encounters
    * portray different types of passengers
    * pretending to sleep? 
      * doesn't have to engage with other passengers
    * experienced passenger?
      * man is different than sanshiro
      * pavlov's passenger: conditioned to wake up when we hear the right station call 
    * sanshiro is more naive than the passenger, more naive than the readers
    * sanshiro takes sleeping man's spot then hirota moves to his old spot
      * psycological distance between themeselve
  * train ride is a prelude to types of people in sanshiro
  * heterogenous space
* marc auge
  * passenger or traveler
  * traveler on the train that moves slower
    * more time to be spent on the train
  * TGV (bullet train) moves so quickly, passenger
    * function of the train becomes more purposive
    * provided same pamphlets, etc as planes
    * no opportunity to experience the journey
    * airplane everyone is passenger
  * traveler concerned about the experience, passenger concerned about the destination
* long distance train is traveler, commuters are passengers
* train vs city
* railway system developed very quickly in japan
  * by 1908, already covered most of honshu and kyushu (maybe hokkaido?) (shikoku?)
  * all the railway system was nationalized
  * people talk exclusively about the russo japanese war
* sanshiro is a country person but many of the things he observes were new to many people in japan
* construction sites in tokyo
  * walking in the city NYC, something always destroyed, something always going up
  * nonomiya noted that it is become too complicated
  * doesn't have the language to describe the experience of the city
* experience of the city is not just physical, if we don't have the words to describe it the experience is lost
  * sanshiro doesn't know how to describe it != sanshiro has no description for it
  * vacuum delineated in the narrative space
* gift store and book store 
  * nonomiya crosses road with many streetcars coming and going
  * sanshiro overwhelmed
  * could have been dangerous
  * nonomiya asked sanshiro to wait outside, even though it is a public space it was a private experience
* saw a girl and thought she was a ghost
* someone who kills herself by train 
  * close by nonomiya's house 轢死/人身事故
  * power of the modern train
  * sanshiro firsthand experienced, heard voice and saw body
  * casualty as spectacle
  * nonomiya not shocked but intrigued "i wish i was there to see it"
  * power of the media not something sanshiro not used to
* strangers on transit
  * criminality of public transportation
  * to look at: voyeurism, if unilateral
  * to listen to: eavesdropping if unilateral
  * to touch: molestation, if unilateral
* zagreb
  * rhythm of the unknown language like the din of the traincar
  * dont have to communicate with her
  * characteristic of the place does not matter beyond its function
* transit
  * non-place
  * in the airport waiting to transfer flights
  * doesn't matter, all airports are "universal" in some sense
  * setting allowed her to tell
    * back in japan can not tell in her family members
    * lack of history allows bonds to be formed
