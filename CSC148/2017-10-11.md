Contains the item, and a reference to the next item. Usually implemented as a series of `Node<T>` where `Node` contains instance of `T` and a reference to the next `T`.

We can keep a reference to the last `Node` to be able to add new items in \(O(1)\) time.'

Common pattern with linked list:
```python
curr  = lst._first
while curr is not None:
   curr.item ... # Continue with this.
   curr = curr.next
```

`__str__`: Returns a string representation of the current object.
`__getitem__`: Implementation of an indexer in Python.
