## Uses for trees
Representing anything with hierarchical stucture

* Inheritance hierarchy
* Arithmetic expressions; (3 - (4 x (6 - 8)) + (25 / 2)
* Structure of files and folders on computer
* Expression trees

```python
class Tree:
  _root: Optional[object]
  _subtrees: List['Tree']
```
* subtrees cannot be None, but they can be empty.

Empty Tree
```
Tree:| List -> Empty List.
     | Root -> None.
```
Leaf:
```
Tree:| List -> Empty List.
     | Root -> Object
```

Node:
```
Tree:| List -> [Tree, ..., Tree]
     | Root -> Object | None
# An empty tree will have no root.

Etc:
Tree<int>(1, 2):| List -> [Tree<int>(2)]
                | Root -> 1
Invalid: 
Tree<int>(None, 2):| List -> [Tree<int>(2)]
                   | Root -> None # We do not care about List, as this violates the RI, and this tree is considered empty.
```

Calculating height of the tree:

```python
def height():
  if self.is_empty():
            return 0
        return max([n.height() for n in self._subtrees], default=0) + 1
```

We only add one if the tree has a value i.e. not empty! Setting `max(default)` to 0 for the case if subtrees is empty, and thus
the height is 0 + 1.

```python
def is_empty():
  return self._root is None
```
