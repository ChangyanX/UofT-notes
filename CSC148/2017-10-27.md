Recipe for writing recursive function

1. Identify the recursive structure of the data.
2. Identify cases where the problem is so simple it can be solved directly (base case)
3. Pick a concrete example that is larger
4. Write down the relavent recursive calls and what they **should** return
5. **Assume** each one does do what it should
6. Figure out how to combine their results to produce the overall result

**The stack is your storage**

Think of the recursive call as a separate function that does do the correct thing, and trace the first level of recursion.
