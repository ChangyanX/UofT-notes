* Classes that relate to each other

* We could define two unrelated classes for similar problems, or abstract common behaviour, and configure particulars later.

* Define a general class, defining methods and attributes that all of the problem domain have in common
* **Shared public interface**

* Classes derived from general class called **subclass**, with _inherit_ all method and attributes of the general class.
* Can modify or add to as needed

* Inheriting attributes is **not automatic** in Python

* If A is a class, and B <: A, then B is a subclass of A.


```python
from datetime import date
class Employee:
  """
  This is an abstract class.
  Only child classes should be instantiated.
  """
  def pay(self, pay_date: date) -> None:
    amount = self.get_monthly_payment()
    print(f'An employee was paid' + 
          '{amount} on {pay_date}')
          
  def get_monthly_payment(self) -> float:
    raise NotImplementedError


class SalariedEmployee(Employee):
  def __init__(self) -> None:
    super().__init__(self)
  
  def get_monthly_payment(self) -> float:
    return 60000 / 12 # some hard coded value
    pass


class HourlyEmployee(Employee):
  def __init__(self) -> None:
    super().__init__(self)
  
  def get_monthly_payment(self) -> float:
    return 160 * 20 # some hard coded value
    pass
```

We say that \(\texttt{SalariedEmployee} <: \texttt{Employee}\), or \(\texttt{SalariedEmployee} \textit{ is-a } \texttt{Employee}\).

Every class is a descendent of `object`. 

## Why bother with an abstract class?
* Cient should not make instance of `Employee`. 
* Client code can know for certain it can call `pay` or `get_monthly_payment` for any subclass of `Employee`.

## Four Kinds of Overriding
* **Complete** unimplemented method.
* **Inherit** a method as-is
* **Replace** an inherited method
* **Extend** the behaviour of an inherited method.

ex. `Monster` has a method `eat` and `Dragon <: Monster` `fluffy` is an instance of either class. 
**Which `eat` is called?**
If `type(fluffy) == Monster`, then `Monster.eat` is called.
If `type(fluffy) == Dragon`, then `Dragon.eat` is called. 

You go up to the parent class until a method is found, or an error is thrown. 

## Inheriting attributes

```python
from datetime import date
class Employee:
  """
  This is an abstract class.
  Only child classes should be instantiated.
  
  === Public Attributes ===
  name: 
    The name of the Employee
  id_:
    The ID of the Employee
  pay_history:
    A record of all times this employee was paid.
  """
  def __init__(self, name):
   self.name = name
   self.id_ = id
   self.pay_history = {}
  
  def pay(self, pay_date: date) -> None:
    amount = self.get_monthly_payment()
    print(f'An employee was paid' + 
          '{amount} on {pay_date}')
          
  def get_monthly_payment(self) -> float:
    raise NotImplementedError


class SalariedEmployee(Employee):
  """
  === Public Attributes ===
  salary:
    The amount this employee is paid for a year of work.
    
  === Representational Invariants ===
  - salary > 0
  """
  def __init__(self, name: str, salary: float) -> None:
    super().__init__(self, name)
    self.salary = salary
  
  def get_monthly_payment(self) -> float:
    return self.salary / 12 # some hard coded value

  hourly_wage:

  hourly_wage: float
  hours_per_month: float
  
  def __init__(self, name: str, hourly_wage: float, hours_per_month: float) -> None:
    super().__init__(self, name)
    self.hourly_wage = hourly_wage
    self.hours_per_month = hours_per_month
  
  def get_monthly_payment(self) -> float:
    return self.hours_per_month * hourly_wage # some hard coded value
