## Function Design

**Recipe** for writing functions
1. Write examples of calls and the expected returned valaues.
2. Write the function header.
3. Add a description of what the function does.
4. Write the body.
5. Test your function.

**Example**
```python
"""
Some doc here
>>> decreases_at([9,17,12,6,99])
>>> 1
"""
>>> decreases_at([9,17,12,6,99])
2
```
* Does the function require additional parameters?
* Does the function return an index or a value?
* Does the function return at index 1 or index 2? (Before or after the point of inflection)

## Type Annotations
```python
def is_even(value: int) -> bool
```

* Communicates to programmers who will use the function
* Writing **client code**
* Allows PyCharm to type-check.

## Design by contract
* Each function provides a service described by the docstring
* Docstrings as contracts
* **Design by contract** *(Is this enforceable in Python ?)*

* Good conceptual chunk of code
* Describe it in 4-5 sentences, or it is too big.

## TDD
### Beginner's testing
* Write calls in shell
* Read results and judge
* Disadvantages?
### Doctest
* Examples in docstrings
```python
def binary_search(lst: List[T], item: T) -> int:
    """Return the index of <t> in <lst>, or -1 if it does not occur.

    Preconditions:
    - L is sorted.
      Specifically, lst[0] <= lst[1] ... <= lst[n-1], where n is len(lst).
    - t can be compared to the elements of lst.

    >>> binary_search([2, 4, 7, 8, 11], 11)
    4
    >>> binary_search([2, 4, 7, 8, 11], 5)
    -1
    """
    ...
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
```

### Pytest

* Asserts

```python
def test_search():
    """Simple test for binary_search."""
    assert binary_search([0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], 5) == 1


if __name__ == '__main__':
    import pytest
    pytest.main()
```

### Choosing test cases
**Example.** _A function to find the maximum in a list._

|Case|Expected|Passed|
|----|--------|------|
|`[1,3,442,2]`|442|OK|
|`[4,3,42,2,256,3]`|256|OK|
|`[356,2,1676,12]`|1676|OK|

**Is this OK?**
* Passed 20 more tests? Passes 100 test cases?

**Confident the function works?**
* Quality not quantity.

**Carve inputs into meaningful categories**, then pick meaningful examples from each category.

#### Defining Categories
* Size of something: 0, 1, larger
* Size: even, odd
* Position: Beginning, Ending, Elsewhere
* Relative location: adjacent, separated
* Duplicates?
* Ordering: unsorted? sorted? increasing/decreasing
* Integers: Negative, positive, 0
* etc.

**Blackbox testing**: Testing blindly, can't see code.
**Whitebox testing**: Testing with the ability to see the code, can make decisions.

#### Property-based testing
Instead of specifying specific input and output, specify a category of inputs, eg. *all lists of integers*, and a propery of the output, eg. *an element of the list, or `None`*.

* Not a very high bar to pass testing
* Still requires specific unit tests

Using `hypothesis` packcage.

```python
@given(list(integers()), integers(), integers())
def test_some_func(list, n1, n2)
  ...
  assert some_func is SomeValue
```


#### Example
```python
def insert_after(list: List[int], n1: int, n2: int) -> None:
    """
    After each occurrence of <n1> in <lst>, insert <n2>
    >>> list = [5, 1, 2, 1, 6]
    >>> insert_after(list, 1, 99)
    >>> list
    [5, 1, 99, 2, 1, 99, 6]
    """
    ...
```

* Presence of `n1` in `lst`, no times, once, more than once.
* Where `n1` occurs in `lst`, front, back and middle
* Presence of `n2` in `lst`.
* `n1 == n2`?
* `len(lst) == 0, == 1, > 0, < 0`
