**Tutorial 7**

Consier the call 

```python
def flatten(lst: Union[int, List]) -> List[int]:
    """Return a list containing all the numbers in <lst>.

    <lst> is a nested list, but the returned list should not be nested.
    The items should appear in the output in the left-to-right order they
    appear in <lst>.

    >>> flatten(5)
    [5]
    >>> flatten([1, [2], 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    """
    # some code here
    

flatten([[1, 5, 7], [[4]], 0, [-4, [6], [7, [8], 8]]])
```

1. What is the correct result?
> `[1, 5, 7, 4, 0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 8]`
2. The argument is a list with four nested lists inside it. Write down the recursive calls that must be made to flatten. Remember to only “go down one level,” to the four nested lists. For each recursive call, write down its correct result.

|Call                  |Result of Call              |Total Result                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
|[1, 5, 7]             |[1, 5, 7]                   |[1, 5, 7]                     |
|[[4]]                 |[4]                         |[1, 5, 7, 4]                  |
|0                     |[0]                         |[1, 5, 7, 4, 0]               |
|[-4, [6], [7, [8], 8]]|[-4, -6, -7, 8, 8]          |[1, 5, 7, 4, 0, 4, 6, 7, 8, 8]|

3. Which of the recursive calls is asking such a simple question that it can be answered directly, without further recursive calls?

> If the argument is an integer, return a list with that integer as the only member. 

Why is this implementation buggy?

```python
def flatten1(lst: Union[int, List]) -> List[int]:
    if isinstance(lst, int):
        return lst
    else:
        result = []
        for lst_i in lst:
            result = [result, flatten1(lst_i)]
        return result
```

However, when we call this:

```python
>>> flatten1([[1, 5, 7], [[4]], 0, [-4, [6], [7, [8], 8]]])
[[[[[], [[[[], 1], 5], 7]], [[], [[], 4]]], 0], [[[[], -4], [[], 6]], [[[[], 7], [[], 8]], 8]]]
```

4. Trace through a call to flatten1 on the base case input that you identified in question 3 above. Does it do the right thing? If not, that’s an error.

If the `lst` is an integer, then it will indeed return an integer but will not return a list integer.
|Call                  |Result of Call              |Total Result                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
|[1, 5, 7]             |
|[[4]]                 |
|0                     |
|[-4, [6], [7, [8], 8]]|
