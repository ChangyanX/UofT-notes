Be careful with stack/heap diff in memory diagrams.

Nested list is either a number or a list of less deep nested lists.


When **tracing** recursive calls, assume that the recursive calls do what it is specified to do. This allows us to reason easily about *any* recursive call.

P(0) ~ todo.
P(3) is true assuming P(0), P(1), and P(2) => P(k+1) assuming P(0)...P(k)
