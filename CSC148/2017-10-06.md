`BackStack` is implemented by appending and popping items from the back of a `list`.
`FrontStack` is implemented by appending and popping items from the front of `list`.

**Why is `BackStack` faster than `FrontStack`?**

Memory is a sequential array of bytes.

While `BackStack` can simply attach or remove from the back of the list, allocating as necessary. Hence, `BackStack` generally takes the same amount of time popping or pushing an item on the stack, as only one item must move, it is \(O(1)\).


`FrontStack` must push or pull **all items** one index position every push or pop. This means that all items must move every time a push or pop is accessed. This makes `FrontStack` \(O(n)\), for \(n\) items in the stack.
