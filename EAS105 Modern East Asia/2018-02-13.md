Lu Xun 1811-1936 modern chinas foremost social critic
> Curious combination in modern china of nationalism and cultural iconoclasms

You would expect nationalists would be proud of cultural traditions; nationalists should be cultural fundamentalists. For a strange reason Chinese nationalists hated the old culture. Wanted to build a new culture. 

Qian Xuantong, a friend of Lu Xun wrote a letter to Chen Duxiu
> Dear Mr. Chen, In an early essay of yours you strongly advocated the abolition of Confucianism. Concerning this proposal of yours I think that it is now the only way to save China. But upon reading it I have thought of one more thing: if you want to abolish Confucianism, you must first abolish the [Classical] Chinese language.
