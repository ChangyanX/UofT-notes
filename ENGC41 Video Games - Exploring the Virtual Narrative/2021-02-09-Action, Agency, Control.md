# 2021-02-09 Action, Agency, Control

* narrative is *an instrument of power*
  * often also **about power**
  * conflict in which power is at stake
  * a way for culture to resolve power
  
* actions
  * verbs are the primary way around which games are organized
  * mechanics, game loops
    * loop: do an action, game shows a response, and you learn something about the game
    * jump: press A, watch mario jump or collide, recognize jump animation
  * atomic (basic) loop is looped multiple times before the user understands what it teaches
  * dissatisfaction in the reader if the physical action does not correspond well enough to the performed action
  * puzzles are ancient fusions between **diversions** and **doorkeys**
  * the more realized the immersive environment, the more active we want to be within it
  * invest sense of agency (murray, hamlet on the holodeck 126)
  * agency means action + results
    * we don't normally expect to experience agency within a narrative environment
* don't care until the player starts to feel what the charater feels
* undertale protagonist
  * has no real emotion
  * mostly see from the back
  * about falling into a space
  * genocide run questions what it means to control
* halo reach
  * also dropped in
  * immediately attached to a space
  * protagonist has a backstory, not a blank space
  * has a name, backstory, role--number 6
  * lone wolf--high respect, killing
  * character backstory motivated by expectation of having played previous games
  * not an entirely blank slate
  * end of the game is revealed at the beginning, final fate of the characters
  * how much meaning can any action taken have?
* video games are interactive so the reader/player has more control (?)
  * not that simple
  * huge range of control
  * **where** is there actually control
* **tainted** replay in undertale, actions persist 
* what actions matter?
  * kill/not kill
  * reading toriel's diary
  * do your actions affect how people see you
  * genocide route: erase/do not erase
    * 'since when were you the one in control'
  * forgive or not characters in undertale
    * how does this affect our sense of plot?
* halo reach is a very linear game
  * no matter how you play, you end up at the same point
  * ultimately you will die
  * start/end at the broken helmet
* how much **control** is pleasurable?
  * pleasure comes from a sense of significant action
  * drawback in a linear game
  * branching narrative, splitting world
  * some of us demand closure, some of us want Kafka
  * to what extent is the search for the next checkpoint part of the plot?
  * are there storytelling limits to this kind of storytelling?
  * frustration as part of the plot, frustration as part of lack of agency
  * what are the meaningful ways that we branch despite ending up at the same end result?
* most narratives come from the cutscene?
  * why is the slow playthrough valueable?
  * does the player make the narrative?
  * readers create narrative, closure
  * usefulness of plot frustration
* question of gender
  * male or female in halo reach
* dante --everyman to beefcake hero
  * dante's inferno
  * god of war, darksiders
  * based on dante's comedy
  * changing of motivation of protagonist
    * dantes comedy is very subtle
    * dante's inferno game is not so subtle
  * power fantasies
  * inferno: why am I to go, who allows me to go
    * dante the pilgrim is weak
    * everyman, little special, but no particular special quality
    * "Hard to sell old poem to boys who want gore and saving women"
  * dante is the thinker? 
  * beefcake dante (protag of dante's inferno game)
    * sewing cloth into his flesh
    * muscular af
    * dante of the game is the dante that the poem rejects
    * dante is not god
    * punish vs absolve
