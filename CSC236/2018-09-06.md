Consider the "chair" tromino

```
*
**
```

Can an \(n \times n\) square grid with one square removed be completely covered by such a tromino?

Consider the case \(n = 1\). Removing one square holds our hypothesis vacuously true. Additionally for \(n =2\), removing one square arbitrarily results in the rotation of the chair tromino.

```
**    -> *
**         **
```
Notice the case for \(n=3\) is not possible, since as we have 3 tiles in a chair, a 3 by 3 grid with one square subtracted has 8 tiles.

For the case \(n=4\) consider the following

```
XXXX
XX_X
XXXX
XXXX
```
