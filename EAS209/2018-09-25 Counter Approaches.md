# 2018-09-25 Counter Approaches

- Counter *orientalist* knowledge about East Asia?
- Is there a need to resist *Orientalism?*
- Is there an outside to *Orientalism*?

- To define Modernity, we must constrast it to something that is *not* modern
  - Some relative concept \(A\) can not be defined a priori, but only when compared to that which is not \(A\).
  - anti-modern
  - post-modern
  - pre-modern
- Requires an "supplementary"
  - Not important, but without which, the main idea can not exist
- Universality and particularism

- Monistic History (一元的歴史)
  - Doesn't look at interconnections
  - Singular, universal, authoratice "world" history
  - One line of progression
  - euro-centralist
  - Hegelian history
  
- Pluralistic History
  - Koyama and Kosaka advocate against Monistic history, and for a pluralistic history
  - Sakai says that they ended up replicating monistic history
  - "World" history conceived of itself as the spacial relation of histories.
  - Koyama 
    - tried to seize a turning point in the development of monistic history
    - world history was about to emerge
      - a singular history to a pluralistic history
    - "mark a fundamental change between the subject of history (West) and its others (Rest)"
  - Pluralistic history is in fact similar to Hegel's monistic history
    - Structure was the same
    - Plurality was delimited to differences between nation states, and not within.
    - Koyama rigourously follows Hegelian construction
    - Unity of subject of history is equated to that of the state, but stress that the state does not correspond to a race (人種) or folk (民族).
      - Disavowed Japan's imperial Modernity
    - "Universal" relations conflate the people, and groups of people as a state
    - Natural communities such as race, nation, clan, or family can "never be the subject of history"
    - According to Koyama, Japan was more "modern", and thus closer to "freedom", and thus entitited to emancipate the rest of Asia
      - Used to justify Japanese expansion
   - One can hardly discern any difference between this understanding of modern subjectivity and that of the Hegelian dialectic
   - State must be able to determine itself, and make decisions itself
     - Embodiment of the will
   - A nation representing itself in the state. Synthesis of a folk and the state.
   - For the folk to transform into a nation, the folk must be negatively mediated by other folk. The folk must conquer and subjugate weaker folks in order to form the nation.
     - Justifies Japan's imperialism
       - "morally emancipate" other nations
   - Koyama's pluralism reality of "Sino-Japanese War", ugliest aspect of universalism
   - If this movement between universalistic and particularistic moralities had proceded, then eventually the coexistence of many histories and traditions would be eliminated. Plural subjects will be gradually organized as particularities of a universal history.
   - Suppressing homogeniety, but eventually replicating Hegelian 
   - Deconstruction of "we/us", nation states that homogenize.
     - Do away with idea of "us"
    - i.e. In order to criticize the West in relation to Japan (or Asia), one must begin with a critique of Japan. Likewise, critique of Japan must entail the radical critique of the West.
- Historicism
  - World History
    - Humanism
    - Constrant progress towards freedom
- Geist
  - East as the beginning of History
  - West as the goal of History
  - Progress towards freedom
  - Modern, "protestant" Germany
  - Childhood of history
  - Not everyone can be free
  - Institutional environment for people to be free

- Oriental Despot
  - Asia as an unfree space
  - King
  - Decides who gets to live, who dies

- Image of Duped Mass
  - Caste
  - Slavery
  - Family-oriented
  - Oriental serfdom
  - Political docility

- Enlightenment
  - Any way out of Enlightenment
  - Even in its resistance Orient is subjugated to the mode of representation dominated by the west
  - "The Orient" lies outside itself
    - that which is excluded and objectified by the West in the service of the West's progress
  - If the west did not exist, then the Orient does not exist.
  - For the non-west, modernity means the state of being deprived of its own subjectivity.
  - The west needs the *other* for its identity. The West can not be possible without the known "rest".
  - The west is also seen as modernity, western liberal ideals.
  - If you want to be modern you must be universal, if you want to be universal, you must be western, and if you are western, then you are particular to western influences.
  - "The Orient resists, it disturbs the West's dominion"

Two ways to resist
  - The orient as subject of world history
    - Orient forms nations to resist Western nations
    - Eliminate heterogeneity within communities to form "the nation"
    - Recognized by, and upload the normative western modern
    - Resists formations of identity which subject people to various institutions but does not liberate them

- No roads to follow/infinite number of rows to follow
  - Resistance as negativity within formation of the subject
  - Never to contribute to the formation of its subjective identity
  - Disrupt formation of the subject
  - 
  - Not to fall into the trap set up by modernity
