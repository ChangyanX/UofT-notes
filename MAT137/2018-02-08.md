Sequences

A *sequence of real numbers* is an infinite list of real numbers written in a specific order like \(a_1, a_2, a_3, ...\). We call \(a_1\) the first term of the sequence. 

A sequence should be thought of like a function. Sequences can come from a function, where if \(f(x)\) is a function then \(\{a_n\}^\infty_{n=0} = f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R} := f(x)\) or they can be recursively defined, for example \(c_1 = 1\) and \(c_{n+1} = 1 + \frac{1}{c_n+1}\)
