Let \(c\) be a real number, and let \(f\) and \(g\) be functions defined everywhere except possibly at c.

Assume 
* \(lim_{x\to c}{f(x)} = 0\)
* \(g\) is bounded. Therefore \(\exists M > 0\text{ st }\forall x \neq c, |g(x)| < M\).
Then \(lim_{x\to c}{[f(x)g(x)]}=0\)

**Rough Work**
\(|g(x)| < M \rightarrow |f(x)g(x)| < M|f(x)|\)
\(|f(x)| < \epsilon \rightarrow |f(x)g(x)| < M \centerdot \frac{\epsilon}{M} = \epsilon\)

If we choose \(M = \epsilon\)
\(|g(x)| < \epsilon \rightarrow |f(x)g(x)| < \epsilon|f(x)|\)
\(|f(x)| < \epsilon \rightarrow |f(x)g(x)| < \epsilon\)


We know 

\(\exists \delta \text{ st } 0 < | x-c | < \delta \rightarrow |f(x)| < \epsilon\).
\(\exists M \text{ st } |g(x)| < M , \forall x \neq C\)

We want show


**Proof**
Let \(\epsilon > 0\).
Let \(\delta =\).

Assume \(0<|x-c|<\delta\).

\(\exists \delta \text{ st } 0 < | x-c | < \delta \rightarrow |f(x)| < \epsilon\).
\(\exists M \text{ st } |g(x)| < M , \forall x \neq C\)

Let \(M > 0\) be such that \(|g(x)| < M, \forall x \neq C\).
Let \(\delta > 0\) be such that \(0 < |x-c|<\delta \rightarrow |f(x)| < \frac{\epsilon}{M}\).

Assume \(0<|x-c|<\delta\).
Then by the definition of M and \(\delta\), 

$$$
|f(x)g(x)| < M|f(x)| < M * \frac{\epsilon}{M} = \epsilon
$$$

**Problem 1** Is the following statement true or flse?
Let *f* be a function. The tangent line to the graph of *y = f(x)* at *x = c* touches the curve only at the point \((c, f( c ))\).

This is **false**.

**Problem 2** Which of the following is true about the tangent line to the graph of *y = x* at *x = 7*.
1. The tangent line is y = 7
2. **The tangent line is y = x**.
3. There is no tangent line to this graph at x = 7
4. There are infinitely many tangent lines to this graph at x = 7

**Problem 3** Let \(c \in \mathbb{R}\). Suppose *f* is a function defined everywhere except at *c*. Which of the following must be true?
1. *f* is differentiable at *c*.
2. ***f* cannot be differentiable at *c*.**
3. We can not say. *f* may or may not be differentiable at *c*.

Differentiable implies continuous.

**Problem 4** Let \(c \in \mathbb{R}\), and suppose *f* is differentiable everywhere except at *c*. Also suppose *f'* is continuous everywhere except at *c*. Which of the following must be true?

1. *f* is continuous at *c*.
2. *f* cannot be continuous at *c*.
3. **We cannot say. *f* may or may not be continuous at *c*.**

Note that 
$$$
\lim_{x \to c}{\frac{f(x) - f(c)}{x - c}} = \lim_{h \to 0}{\frac{f(c+h) - f(c)}{h}}
$$$

**Problem**
Let *g* be the following function:
$$$
g(x) = \Bigg\{x < 0: \sin{x}, x \geq 0: x \Bigg\}
$$$

Is \(g\) differentiable at 0?

What is the limit of g(x) as x approaches 0 from the left?

$$$
\lim_{x \to 0^-}{\sin{x}} = 0
$$$

What is the limit of g(x) as x approaches 0 from the right?
$$$
\lim_{x \to 0^+}{x} = 0
$$$

Since the side limits agree, 
$$$
\lim_{x \to 0}{g(x)} = 0
$$$

Do these limits exist?
$$$
g'(0) = \lim_{x \to 0}{\frac{g(x) - g(0)}{x}}
$$$


$$$
\lim_{x \to 0^-}{\frac{g(x) - g(0)}{x}} = \lim_{x \to 0^-}{\frac{\sin{x}-\sin{0}}{x}} = \lim_{x \to 0^-}{\frac{\sin{x}}{x}} = 1
$$$

$$$
\lim_{x \to 0^+}{\frac{g(x) - g(0)}{x}} = \lim_{x \to 0^+}{\frac{x-0}{x}} = \lim_{x \to 0^+}{\frac{x}{x}} = 1
$$$
