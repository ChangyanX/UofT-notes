## Height between binary tree and trees balanced.

height|fewest nodes|most nodes
------|------------|----------
1|1|1
2|2|3
3|3|7
4|4|15
5|5|31
h|h|\(2^h\)-1

\# of nodes in a tree of height
\(n \leq 2^h -1\)
\(log_2(n+1) \leq h\)

### Keeping trees balanced
* Rotation
### Recursion isn't always structural
* Recursive over a recursive structure
  * sum over nested list of ints
  * height of tree
  * print files under given folder
* Sometimes build a recursive structure on the fly
  * Randomly building a Block for A2
  * AbstractFileTree from given folder
* Neither
  * tiling
  * recursive binary search

We can only do binary search on a sorted list.
  * insertion sort
  * bubble sort

All are iterative.
