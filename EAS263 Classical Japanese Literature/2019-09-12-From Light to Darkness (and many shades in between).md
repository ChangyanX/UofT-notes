* The Tale of Genji　(源氏物語)

## Modern Reflections

* **Tanizaki Jun'ichirou *In Praise of Shadows*. (1933, trans. Seidensticker 1977)**
  * An essay expressing Tanizaki's thoughts in traditional Japanese aesthetics
  * "Japanese culture would appreciate shadows over light"
  * In various forms: architecture, cuisine, interior design
  * Appreciation of the the dimness to each space
    * cf. western toilet, traditional japanese toilet
      * in Western toilets, hygiene is the most important (sparkling clean), so we have bright lighting.
      * in Japanese toilets, it's better if you can't see the toilet, so the lighting is minimal.
  * Luminosity is not as appreciated as in Western architecture. Light used very sparingly and strategically, to only highlight certain elements, emerging from the darkness.
* **Hiratsuka Raichou *In the Beginning, Woman was the Sun... Now Woman is only the moon.* (1971, trans. Craig 2006)**
  * Hiratsuka was a Japanese feminist and estalblished a feminist publishing journal.
  * "In the Beginning, Woman was the Sun..." (「元始、女性は太陽であった」) refers to the story of Amaterasu (天照大神　アマテラスオオカミ), referred to in the Heldt translation of Kojiki as Hᴇᴀᴠᴇɴ Sʜɪɴɪɴɢ"
    * Amaterasu has two brothers, Tsukiyomi (月読命　ツクヨミノミコト) (Heldt: Mᴏᴏɴ Cᴏᴜɴᴛɪɴɢ) the moon god, and Susano-o (素戔嗚命/須佐之男命　スサノオノミコト) (Heldt: Rᴀɢɪɴɢ Mᴀɴ) god of the sea and storms
  * Originally the moon was embodied as a male figure, but in modern society Hiratsuka notes that like the moon, "women can only shine with the help of a man (the sun)"
* In our modern society, being clear and direct is seen as desirable, but this is a very cultural consideration.


## Kojiki &mdash; 古事記
* Dictated from oral performance of legends
* Completed in 712 followed closely by 日本書紀 (Chronicle of Japan) in 720
* Written in Chinese script, in classical and sinitic Japanese
  * Not in the *Chinese language*, uses Chinese characters to transliterate Japanese (万葉仮名).
  * Chinese characters used for both meaning and sound.
  * Very difficult to read, because it is unclear which part uses characters for meaning, and which for sound.
  * One reason for the compilation of 日本書紀, was to compile a history of Japan, written in classical Chinese. 日本書紀 was then considered the "official history".
* Written by Hieda no are (稗田 阿礼), Ou no Yasumaro (太 安万侶).
  * Hieda no are narrated
  * Ou no Yasumaro scribed the narration.
* Deities and Emporers' Biographies in loosely chronological order
  * Because this is a story more of mythology, there are no concrete dates. However there is a linear progression of events that is preserved in the record.

### Deities
* Izanagi (伊邪那岐命/伊弉諾尊　イザナギノミコト) (Heldt: Hᴇ Wʜᴏ Bᴇᴄᴋᴏɴs) and Izanami (伊邪那美命/伊弉冉尊　イザナミノミコト) (Heldt: Sʜᴇ Wʜᴏ Bᴇᴄᴋᴏɴs)
  * Izanagi and Izanami are not only couples, but siblings.
    * cf. Greek mythology Hera and Zeus incest taboo.
    * Anthropological note: Incest taboo reserved for gods and goddesses, not for humans.
  * Izanagi visiting Izanami in the underworld.
    * cf. story of Orpheus and Eurydice
    * "Please wait here and don't look", but Izanagi looked.
    * Very dark in the underworld, Izanagi lit a fire with his comb, and saw Izanami's maggot ridden corpse. 
    * Invisibility in the darkness is overcome by the torch.
    * Izanagi is like a voyeur, saw something he shouldn't have seen.
    * Light brings knowledge, but could have negative consequences
      * cf. biblical myth of Adam and Eve, apple of Eden
    * Light can be thought of a weapon, but can also bring violence and violation.
* Amaterasu was considered the most powerful deity, but not the first. Fathered by Izanagi and Izanami.
  * After her reunion with Susano-o, she hid herself in the cave in fear, bringing darkness to the world.
    * Upset at her brother's rage and violence.
    * Perhaps a myth originating from total solar eclipses
    * Consider how she tried to interpret her brother's rage positively, but she could not stand it any more and hid herself.
    * Consider strategy of conflict resolution.
      * "Went on a strike"
    * Other deities tried to drag her out of the cave.
      * Used a mirror to attempt to fool her with her own radiance.
      * Mirrors reflect light; even in the darkness Amaterasu can see her reflection
## Tale of A Bamboo Cutter &mdash; 竹取物語
* Prose fiction from the 10th century
* Author unknown
* Fiction was not considered very important, so the exact date of completion was not recorded.
* Circulated and read widely.
* Written in Classical Japanese in Japanese script (mixture of Chinese and Japanese characters)
* Written primarily for entertainment, rather than for any official purpose.
* Considered to be the first narrative fiction (described as the ancestor of narrative fiction in *The Tale of Genji* "Picture Contest")

    * Kaguya-hime begins to remember her past, and thus looking at the moon evokes very strong emotions.
* > "You look sad at when you look at the moon. Don't be so depressed. People say it is bad to look at the moon too much"

## The Pillow Book &mdash; 枕草子
* Written in Classical Japanese in the 10th-early 11th century by Sei Shonagon (清少納言)
* Characterized as an essay (随筆 *zuihitsu*), combination of a diary/memoir (日記 *nikki*) and poetic catalogue (類聚 *ruijuu*).
  * Two strands of narrative, which interleave throughout.
  * The memoirs are records of events that happened to her.
  * **The poetic catalogues are the "reference material" for the purposes of poetic composition &mdash; material to consult when composing poems.**
    * May not be spotaneously written, does follow some literary conventions, despite seeming not so at first glance.
    * The way of address is very precise and straightfoward, so we may assume that she is just elaborating on her feelings and preferences, however in Classical Japan, individualism may not be so individual.
      * Social values and collective perceptions were shared by people of the era.
      * Writing about the collective sensibilities and aesthetic tastes.
      * When she writes of the seasons, she is speaking more so about the collective sensibilities, perhaps more so than her personal opinions.
    * Sei Shonagon was a very avid reader; summarizing her literary experience/sensibilities of the time 
    * Lists things that are impressive and why they are impressive.
      * If you were to compose poems about a subject, you refer to her writings to get a sense of the sensibilities that the poems should hold.

  * Very well read in Chinese literary, which was unusual for a woman.
