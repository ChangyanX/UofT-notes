* Late 10th century

* Genre: memoir
  * a diary in modern day is chronological, recollection of recent past
  * in ancient times a 日記 was an official record of events at court.
  * memoirs are different from diaries in sense of time, memoirs were written sometimes significantly later from the events.
  * someone would remember events from the past, but not an instantaneous record of events
* In Chinese (for factual documentation), and Japanese (for introspective)
* Poetic tale with prose embedding poems
* We don't know if the central character is the author
  * authors did not really care to attach names to memoirs
* Kagerou Nikki has a lot of poems inserted
  * Poetry was very important in the era

  * Must also be able to learn how to write poems
  * Very natural to be able to compose poems on the spot
* In Kagerou Nikki, the husband is not faithful to the narrator
  * Narrator is not happy, expected more loyalty
  * Poetry as a mode of argument
  * Reply would have to pick up some words and reuse it to make an argument
* In the real world, things don't go well, things do go as planned, and need to deal with unexpected incidents
* not just fairy tales
* grammar can be used in other disciplines like literature
  * not just a spontaneous creation
  * literature has established conventions that may be considered
  * how to subvert established norms?
* Usually in a romance there is courtship, rivalry, rejection, etc.
* Poems become of dispute, but began of courtship, etc.
  * Narrator writes to the main wife of the husband and they collude/commiserate with each other because there is a new woman.
  * Strange friendship is developed through poetic exchange
  * Not really normative way of poem exchange

* Genji would invite suitors to attract the attention of his daughter
* Perhaps more similar to a different version where the bamboo cutter is romantically attracted to Kaguya-hime
