# 2019-10-10 Prose and Poetry
* Utamonogatari 歌物語
  * Prose fiction with poems embedded
* Kotobagaki　詞書
  * Preface to a poem
  * Prose explanation of the circumstances of composition of a poem
    * May include featured flora or fauna
* Consider similarity between utamonogatari and kotobagaki; end results look very similar.

## Mutivalence (multiplicity of voices)
* Editor of the anthology/author of the tale where the poem is placed
* The author of the poem
* The narrator of the preface or rale
  * First person, presence manifests in varied degrees
* Protagonist of the poetic tale
  * First or third person
* Speaker of the poem
  * First person, monologue or dialogue
  * May be in conversation (dialogue), or talking to himself
  * May be dialogic (function of the narrative)
  * Personal pronouns, directly represented or mediated
  * Person who is presenting the poem
  * Lyric poetry about emotions, thoughts 
  * Epic poetry about historical events
    * In Chinese adaptations, political messages, eg. Po-chu-i's poems
    * In Japanese adaptations, may focus more on romantic side
* Narrator is the term used for prose, and speaker used for poetry

## Ise Monogatari 伊勢物語
* A sequence of episodes featuring a nameless "man" referred to in third person
* Seems to tell the story of one man's life chronologically
* Person is never named, is anonymized.
* The person is referred to as 'I' only within the poems he composed
* Some episodes include poems by others with whom the man exchanged poems
* No connection between episodes, some debate about whether the man the same.
  * Can be read as multiple people
* Author intended to present it as a chronological progression (?)
* The prose part is presented by someone other than the protagonist; referring to the protagonist as 'he'.
  * If the poems were composed by 'him', then 'I' is used.
  * If the poems were composed by those he exchanged with, then 'him' is referred to by 'you'.
* The poems were supposedly composed by a fictional 'him', but in reality we have the poems are composed by Ariwara no Narihira (在原業平), one of the six poetic geniuses.
  * We know 87 of his poems were selected in anthologies, beginning with Kokinshu
* Also known as Zaigo chuujou nikki (在五中将日記)
  * Ariwara was the 5th son, hence (在五)
  * He was a captain (中将)
  * Suggests that this story are the memoirs of Ariwara no Narihira.
* Usually would be important that the poets were identified as Ariwara no Narihira.
  * Even if his name name appears, because of the authorship of the poems we are reasonable to assume that Ariwara no Narihira had something to do with the creation of Ise Monogatari.
* Ise Monogatari is always in third person, a layer of mediation, so it may not have been written by Ariwara no Narihira himself.
  * Ariwara no Narihira is for sure the author of most of the poems. He also assumes the role of the speaker.
  * He does not assume the role of the narrator.

## Heichu Monogatari 平中物語
* Structure very similar to Ise Monogatari
* Lyric poems embedded in each episode
* Outside the poems, the protagonist is 'he'
  * discrepancy between the speaker and narrator
* About this playboy named Heichu
  * Very comical
  * Compare with Ise, the descriptions here are very vulgar
* Most poems in the tales of Heichu were traced back to Taira no Sadafumi 平貞文
* 26 poems collected in commissioned anthologies
* Poems surrounding the story must be 平中日記 or 貞文日記
* Is this fiction or autobiography?
  * Mediated through a narrator
  * By calling the text 平中日記 we are implying that this is an autobiography.
  * If instead we call this 平中物語, we err on the side that it is fictuitous.

## Izumi Shikibu Nikki 和泉式部日記
* Seemingly chronological account of the experience of a "woman" (referred to as "she")
* More flowing narrative; not divided into episodes
* Prose embedding poems composed by a women, who refers to herself as "I", and those exchanged: refers to protagonist as "you"
* About a woman mourning her late lover living in solitude
* Receives the visit of the pageboy who used to serve her boyfriend, an imperial prince
  * Pageboy said that he was now serving the prince's brother
* Izumi no Shikibu was a contemporary of Sei Shonagon and Murasaki Shikibu
* Izumi Shikibu was best known as a distinguished poet
* Murasaki Shikibu was less well regarded as a poet, than a prose writer.
* Sei Shonagon was also appreciated as a poet but not *the best*
* Izumi no Shikibu was very distinguished, so much so that she has 240 poems in commissioned anthologies.
* Even has her personal anthology of 1500 poems
* Someone may have written about her life using her poems, hence we have 和泉式部物語, however the title 和泉式部日記 was circulated more &mdash; for some reason this was accepted more as an autobiography than a fiction.

## ambiguity
* In poetic anthologies, we see the title
  * Why we decided to call the title this way
  * Not so much in terms of prose fiction
* Nothing is added much by giving the author

## Kagerou Nikki
* Authored by 藤原道綱母, real name not known.
  * 36 poems selected in imperially commissioned anthologies
* Husband was 藤原兼家　ふじわらのかねいえ
* Memoir with embedded poems by her and exchanges.
* Presented as 蜻蛉日記
  * Narrator-I: narrator is also the protagonist
  * No confusion about the mediation or genre def'n
