# 2019-09-26 Chinese vs. Japanese

* We may have had a notion that Chinese and Japanese are distinct, separate from each other in Classical Japanese literature, but this is not true.

## Kokinshu 古今和歌集
* Edited by Ki no Tsurayuki, Ki no Tomonori, Oushikouchi no Mitsune, Mibu no Tadamine, commissioned by Emperor Daigo
* First of the 21 imperially commissioned anthology
* Divided into topics or categories rather than chronologically
* Spring and autumn are more transition, and subtlety is preferred
* Most poems were compiled in capital of Kyoto
* Kokinshu was very representative of the capital
  * Regional poems were likely to have been a result of official missions by capital officials
* Later poets criticized Kokinshu, saying it came from the head, not the heart
  * relying on wit than emotion
* Most dominate category is love
* Miscellaneous poems do not fit any categories
* Some of the categories were rather prevalent in Chinese poetry
  * Farewell songs (離別歌)
* Even though these poems were Japanese poems, was still under a very strong Chinese influence in terms of structure and subject
* Kokinshu was edited in beginning of 10th century
  * comparison between three anthologies of Chinese poems
    * Kudai waka (894)
      * catalogue of poems composed on lines from Chinese poems
    * Shinsen Man'youshuu (893, rev. 913)
      * Collection of Japanese poems written in Chinese characters, with **accompanying Chinese translation**
      * Early Japanese poems were written in Chinese characters
* Chinese poems had acquired a very high prestige, so the editors wanted to raise the status of Japanese poetry
## Wakan rouei shuu
  * Edited by Fujiwara no Kintou
    * Bureaucrat, poet, scholar of poetry
  * Both Japanese poems and Chinese poems were included
  * Poems to be sung
  * Excerpts from Chinese poems and other texts
  * Translation used different fonts to differentiate Chinese from Japanese poems
  * Po-chu-i is very much represented in Wakan Rouei Shuu
    * but not the major poets
  * For some reason in Japan, Po-chu-i is favoured
    * his book was very available
    * had to wait several years to get new books from China
    * Very accessible, wanted to have his poems accessible to those without education
      * legend would be that po-chui would read poems to his illiterate neighbour and see if she would be impressed
    * very one sided relationship, Chinese people would rarely hear about Japanese literature and reception of Chinese literary works (Po-chu-i was told that his poems were popular in Japan)
  * China and Japan used to have formal diplomatic relationships, but discontinued at the end of the 9th century (894)
    * Japan would no longer send regular envoys to China, including monks, students, books
  * Tang poems were well read by Japanese readers
  * Chinese poems composed by Japanese poets, often inspired by Chinese poems
  * Arranged by poetic topics
    * must be recognized and celebrated in literary tradition
    * taken from Chinese poetic categories
  * Only 2 volumes with several hundred poems
    * vol. 1 Seasonal
    * vol. 2 Miscellaneous
  * Japanese poems were mostly given in 31 syllables by this time.
  * Chinese poems were much longer. The shortest Chinese verse is 4 lines with 5 characters in a line, and there were longer ones with 8 lines, 7 chars each. 
    * Chinese words were also very monosyllabic. cf. Japanese words were very polysyllabic
    * For this reason, usually 2 lines were excerpted from the Chinese poems for each selection
* Male bureaucrats were expected to know Chinese poetry, philosophy, and history.
  * Would have to know major works
  * If you were a woman, or not as studious, it was not as important
    * Sources were available to acquire partial knowledge of Chinese literature
    * Textbooks, reference books, catalogues, to refer to
* Some topics were considered to be too vulgar
  * mosquitos were too vulgar, but cicadas were fine
  * these topics were learned from the Chinese tradition
## Genji Monogatari
  * 54 volumes in which Genji's life was his offspring are narrated
  * Usually when we read narrative fiction, our focus is what will happen
    * we may appreciate not just the narrative but also the form and structure of the text
  * First chapter covers before Genji's birth and beginning of adulthood
  * Emperor marries a new woman that looks exactly like Genji's mother
  * Genji given the name "Shining Prince" (Genji)
  * Genji doesn't love Aoi very much, was more of a political marriage
    * planned behind Genji's back by the Emperor
  * Aoi killed by Rokujou Haven
  * Rokujou Haven very proud woman, came in disguise to Genji's procession
  * by our standard, supernatural possession was not very scientific
    * at the time of writing, it was a very real thing not just fantasy
    * used Buddhist monks to exorcise
    * used poppyseed to cast away the spirit from Aoi.
      * when spirit returns to Rokujou Haven, her body smelled of poppyseed.
  * one source of inspiration for the tale of Genji would perhaps be kagerou diary
    * Rokujou Haven, when she was jealous
  * Tale of Genji is an adaptation of existing stories, as well as something new
  * Genji has not many children, only one daughter
    * decided to adopt a daughter to be used politically
    * however his feelings towards her change because of her beauty
  * The seer/the paulownia court
    * Kiritsubo Haven (Genji's mother) can be compared to Yang Guifei
      * Emperor's love goes beyond appropriate
      * Hatred of other women cause her fate
      * died at her mother's house, before she lived at court
      * messenger brought Kiritsubo Haven's hairpin 
        * cf. yang guifei hairpin
    * cf. Kaguya hime (one person attracting too much love)
    * Seer (fortune teller)
      * adopts Bai Juyi's Changhen ge (Long lasting sorrow/pain)

## Kara monogatari (late 12th C)
* Use of Yang Guifei's story
* Collection of 27 stories centered on various people in Chinese literature
* Many Chinese figures were celebrated in Japanese literary tradition
* Compiled for entertainment and for **education**
* May or may not have had access to formal education to Chinese literature.
  * in such a case a Japanese text such a Kara monogatari would be useful
* Poems were inserted in text, in Japanese language but the characters were Chinese
  * The poems were adopted into Japanese
* **Youkihi** is the Japanese pronunciation of Yang Guifei
  * Noh playwrights were not aristocracy
  * Komparu Zenchiku (how could he know, how was he educated in Chinese tradition? 15th C)
    * Many textbooks, reference books in Japanese
    * already medieval Japan, class hierarchy was not as strict as Classical times.
    * education was not institutional, but very one-on-one
* Buddhist themes of being unable to attain nirvana because of too much attachment to the world in Noh theatre
  * in this case, Youkihi can not attain nirvana as she still misses the emperor too much
  * while Noh is very Japanese form of theatre, still a lot of Chinese theatre

* Not the original of the author
* inspired by Feng Menglong's vernacular fiction of a snake woman
* very widely read
