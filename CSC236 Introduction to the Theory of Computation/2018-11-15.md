## Languages Part 2

> **definition**
> *alphabet*
> Finite, non-empty set of symbols. Conventionally denoted \(\Sigma\)

> **definition**
> *string*
> finite, including empty, sequence of symbols over an alphabet. By convention, \(\varepsilon\) denotes the empty string, and \(\Sigma^*\) is the set of all strings over \(\Sigma\).

> **definition**
> Subset of \(\Sigma^*\) for some alphabet \(\Sigma\). Possibly empty, possibly infinite subset. Note that \(\{\} \neq \{\varepsilon\}\).

Given a language \(L\), and string \(s\) is \(s \in L\)?
