## Binary Search

Consider an algorithm that takes input a **sorted** list of number, and a **number** \(x\), and we want to discover if \(x\) is in the list.

|\(i_0\)| | | | |\(L\)| | | | |\(j_0\)|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|


Check if \(x\) = \(L\), if \(x \neq L\), then either \(x < L\), hence we set \(i_1 = i_0\), and \(j_1 = L\), and \(L = \lceil \frac{i_1 + j_1}{2} \rceil\), and similarly for \(x  > L\). Condition for while loop to stop is \(j_k - i_k \leq 0\)

*Part C*: Show that where \(r_k = j_k + i_k\) that \(r_{k+1} \leq \frac{r_k}{2}\)
*Part D*: Show that \(Runtime \in O(\log n)\) Notice that \(r_0 = n, \land r_k = j_k - i_k\). As long as the while loop doesn't finish my \(k+1\), that \(r_{k+1} \leq \frac{r_k}{2}\), and that the loop terminates when \(r_q = 0\) when \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2^q} \rfloor = 0 \iff q = \log {n + 1}\). 

*Part E*: Show that \(WC \in \Omega(\log n)\). In other words, find some family of inputs such that the input takes at least \(\Omega(\log n)\). Let \(L\) be a list of length \(n\) where \(x\) is not in \(L\). Then the algorithm will never exit early, so it will take at least \(\log n\) time.

## Average Case
Between worst-case and best-case. Describes the "typical" runtime on inputs of length \(n\). Average case can be surprisingly more difficult to analyse. To compute the average case runtime of an algorithm, we have to define the set of all inputs of length \(n\). Generally, \(\tau^A_n =\) set of all inputs to algorithm \(A\) of length \(n\). Then, 

\[Average_A (n) = \frac{\sum_{x \in \tau_n^a} Runtime_a(x)}{|\tau^A_n|}\]

Where \(|\tau^A_n|\) is the size of \(\tau^A_n\).

Consider the algorithm 

```python
def find1(L):
  n = len(L)
  for i in range(1, n):
    if L[i] = 1:
      print(i)
      return
```
Input is a list of \(n\) numbers. For example in the case \(n=3\) \(\tau^{find1}_{3}\) is all permutations of \({1, 2, 3}\), for example 

```
123, 132, 213, 312, 231, 321
```

Notice that the runtimes in order are `1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3`. Hence the average runtime is \(\frac{12}{6} = 2\).

We can partition the inputs into \(n\) different groups, where \(T_{n, i}\) is all the inputs where 1 is in the location \(i\), and all of these inputs have runtime \(i\).

Hence the average runtime on \(\tau_n\) is

\[
  \frac{|T_{n, 1} + 2|T_{n,2}|+...+n|T_{n,n}|}{\tau_n}
\]

Notice that \(|\tau_n| = n!\). What is the size of \(|T_{n,1}|\)? Notice that \(T_{n,1}\) is all permutations of \(1...n\). where 1 is in location 1. Hence we have that \(T_{n, 1} = (n-1)!\), and similarly for \(T_{n, i}\). Hence we have that the average case is equal to

\[\sum_{i=1}^n i \cdot \frac{(n-1)!}{n!}\]

Which eventually is in \(\Theta(n)\)
