## What is CSC165
*  **communication/expression**
   * with or through programs
   * with other developers
   * knowing what you mean
   * analyse programs and arguments

 * **CS Needs Math:**
   * graphics (calculus, linalg)
   * computer vision
   * software verification (logic)
   * cryptography / privacy (number theory)
   
  ## Doing well in CSC165
  
  * **2 Aspects**
    * Get a good grade (make PoST)
    * Retain concepts and tools for later courses
* Read the course webpage and emails
* Understand deadlines and couse info sheet
* Don't fall behind (8-10hrs /week)

## Balance between rigour and language
* Challenge to find precision/detail and high level
  * too much -> tedious and unbearable
  * too little -> ambiguous and unclear
* Good proofs are like good literature:
  * communicate with humans
  * best ones are rigourous, suspense and surprise

## Example of ambiguity
* You can have cake or ice cream
  * "You can have one or the other"
  * However `OR` implies both. (Inclusive OR).
* If you can solve any problem in this course, you will get an A
  * What does any mean? 
    * Solve a single problem?
    * Solve all problems?
  * What if you can not solve 'any' problem,
* If you are a Pittsburgh Pens fan, you are not a Philly Flyers fan
  * What if you are not a Penguins fan?
    * Vacuous statement.
