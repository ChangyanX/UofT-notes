* Grammaticality prediction is practical
* Want some superficial access to language
* Use for practical considerations
  * grammar check
* Hard to imagine that next breakthrough would not use statistical model, but breakthrough may not solely come from statistical language model
* Making sense seems to be *more important than being grammatical*
* A lot of statistical methods are not language modelling
  * LM, but put NN layers on top of it
  * LM is supervised, but LM only looks at next word
  * Grammaticality modelling requires more supervision

## Syntax, Grammar, Parsing
* Syntax:
  * combinatorial structure of words
  * Left/right precedence, contiguity in linear organized words
  * words are hierachically organized into phrases and sentences
  * words organized into string
  * which order of words lead to grammatical strings?
  * we care about meaning, not just grammaticality
  * [[The cat] [hunted [the squirrel [living [in [the tree]]]] [with persistence]]
  * Goal: meaning, interpretation, semantics]
  * We can perhaps gain access into semantics without necessarily parsing trees
* Grammar:
  * **formal specification** of allowable structures
    * knowledge
    * representation
  * Which words grouped together into phrases
  * How words within a phrase project the head?
  * How phrases relate to each other
  * grammar encodes these relations, with respect to meaning
  * some are better than others, but no one agrees what is better
  * desiderata:
    * faithfulness to (vastly divergent) details about language
    * economy of description
    * fidelity to prevailing linguistic intuition
      * should model movement
    * efficiency of parsing
      * human parsing (surfance form, etc: review lin102)
  * Given UG, and set params we have a grammar of a certain language
* Parsing:
  * **analysis** of strings of words to determine the structure assigned by grammar
    * algorithm
    * process
    * Corpus annotated with implicit or explicit grammar
* Primitives: lexical categories
  * Each **word-type** is a member of one or more word
  * A **word-token** is an instance of exactly one word\
  * eg. The cat in the hat sat.
    * 5 word types ("the" is repeated)
    * 6 word tokens 
  * Categories are open and closed to new words.
  * Some number of main categories of words, many subcategories
    * Noun: denote object, concept place, etc.
    * Pronouns: he, she, you, I
      * pronouns in English respect case (e.g He, Him, His)
    * Adjectives: denote attribute of the denotation of the noun
    * Determiners: specify certain attributes of the denotation of a noun that are grammatically relevant
      * In English, a noun can not appear by itself, need a DET
    * Verbs: predicates, denote an action or a state
      * May be distinct wrt transitivity
      * Intransitive: sleep, die
        * subject being in a state or changing state
      * Transitive: eat, kiss
        * have two arguments (have object)
      * Ditransitive: give, sell
        * have three arguments (one has subject, one object, indirect object eg. give Mary an apple)
      * Copular: be, feel, become
        * associate one subject with another description
      * Adverbs: denote attribute of the denotation of a predicate
      * Preposition: relate two phrases with a location, direction, manner, etc.
      * Conjunctions: combine two clauses or phrases
      * Interjections: standalone emotive expressions
  * See LIN102 notes for proper category definition. Remember that syntactic categories are distributional not semantic
  * Phrase: hierachical grouping or words or phrases
  * Clause: a phrase consisting of verb and almost all dependents
  * Sentence: a clause that is syntactically independent of other clauses
  * Can be represented by tree or bracketing
  * A constituent is a well-formed phrase with overtones of semantic or psychological significance
