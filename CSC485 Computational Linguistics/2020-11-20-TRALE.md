* Overview of A3
1. Using features as grammar 
   1. Very easy, basically copy and paste
   2. Use features. (lower case fred is fine)
   3. Provided a CFG grammar, strip out unnecessary things and use features instead
2. Verb complements and gap feature
   1. Get stub grammar, finish he grammar
   2. Think through carefully how to represent argument structure, thematic roles, alternatives to gap features
      1. If you use gaps, wrong direction
   3. Pay attention to 4 bullet points on page 4
   4. Edit `v_sem` to store thematic roles
      1. Thematic roles 'look like' features

## Thematic Roles
1. Agent: initiator of action (capable of volitional)
2. Patient*: entity undergoing effect of some action or change of state
3. Theme: entity moved by the action or whose location is described
4. Experiencer: entity which is aware of the action or state
5. Beneficiary (Recipient)


* Agent vs Experiencer
  * Agent has control over the action, experiencer does not
  * He sleeps (exp) vs. He takes a nap (agt)
* Theme vs Patient
  * Patient has to undergo some action or change
  * He destroys the mailbox (pat) vs. he likes the mailbox (thm)
* Clauses as roles
  * complement clause can be assigned THM from verb. NPs are not the only constituents that can be assigned thematic roles.
