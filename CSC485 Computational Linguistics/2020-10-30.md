* we can use phrase structure grammar trees to enforce agreement
  * unification may not always succeed, if that happens give up on the parse
  * when it does succeed, we may combine information consistently 
* distinguish structure from 'functional info'
* economoy of specification
  * equational constraints in rules
  * sets of values in lexicon
* lexicon
  * may contain inflected form
  * may contain only base form
    * time-space tradeoff
    * morphological analysis maps input inflected form to base form
  * may contain semantics for each form
* morphological analysis is simple in english
  * reverse rules for inflection, including spelling changes
    * dogs -> dog [Agr 3p]
    * eats -> eat [Agr 3s, Tns pres]
    * buses -> bus [Agr 3p]
  * irregular forms have to be explicitly listed
    * children -> child [Agr 3p]
    * sang -> sing [Tns past]
  * language with compounding (German) or agglutination (Finnish) need more sophisticated rules
    * Verdauungsspaziergang is a stroll that one takes after a meal to assist in digestion
  * we do not always traditional grammar
* semantics can be a lexical feature, but there isn't that much meaning
  * meaning of dog, chien, Hund are all `dog`.
* verb subcategorization
  * constraints on verbs and complements (arguments)
  * nadia told / instructed / \*said / \*informed Ross to sit down.
  * we need a representation that tells us the grammatical function, which will assign us semantics
  * levin verb classes
  * much more complex that just V with optional NP or PP
    * can include more than 1 NP
    * clauses of various types, complementizer CPs
  * subcat feature on verb indicating kinds of verb phrase it allows
    * _np, _np_np, _inf, _np_inf,... 
    * very similar to agreement when resolving
  * more than subcat has to be indicated
    * tense, aspect markings, locate event in time, and complete/in progress
    * english has lack of overt morphology to indicate aspect
* modal verbs
    * aux verbs that express degrees of certainty, obligation , possibility
    * could, would, should, etc.
    * can restrict features to get a general structure for english sentences
* voice
  * passive
    * the ball was kicked (existential passive -- there exists an agent s.t. ball was kicked by the agent)
    * the ball was kicked by the goalie (agentive passive -- agent explicitly specified)
  * diathetic alternation, not a tense nor aspect, but looks like tense or aspect, so semantic representation doesn't change
