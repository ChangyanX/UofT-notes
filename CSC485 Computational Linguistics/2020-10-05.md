* learning "ontologies from text" important research topic
* learning common sense knowledge from text: information extraction
* learning temporal information
* vector space embeddings from unannotated text
  * some combinations of these relations emerge
* Subcategorization of verbs
  * which kinds of VP can be used with what NPs
  * can classify VPs by what phrases they can take
* Verbs are more complex than nouns
  * they are predicates encode relations between their arguments
  * selectional restriction
    * agent of eat must be animate, theme must be physical, edible
    * only necks can be 'craned'
    * different senses of verb may impose different restrictions
    * some are very precise
    * argument types may disambiguate verb-sense
    * numerous subregularities in how senses cluster
  * taxonomy is difficult
    * grouping is not clear,
    * differentiating sisters are not clear
  * WordNet just avoided verbs only get shallow troponyms
    * to saunter -> to walk in a certain manner
  * insufficient information about thematic roles, subcategorization, selectional restrictions
  * no regularity in behaviour of classes of verbs
* Levin's verb clasifications
  * groups english verbs by diathesis alternations
    * syntactic patterns of argument structure
    * shows mapping between semantics of verbs and syntactic behaviour
  * [Verb class 45.1] break, crack, rip, ...
    * Jay broke Bill's finger
    * \*Jay broke Bill on the finger
    * Jay broke the vase
    * Vases break easily
    * Kay touched Bill's neck
  * [Verb class 20] touch, stroke, tickle
    * Kay touched Bill's neck
    * \*Cats touch easily
  * For verbs in class 45.1 we need change of state for middle construction
  * Spray-load alternation
    * Nadia sprayed paint onto the wall
    * Nadia sprayed the wall with paint (in some sense more 'complete')
    * Paint sprayed onto the wall. (spray-load)
    * \*The wall sprayed with paint
    * \*Walls spray easily
  * Levin has ~80 alternations, ~190 verb classes, ~3000 classified verbs
    * used extensively in CL 
    * VerbNet embeds Levin's classes in computational lexicon
    * adds thematic roles and sentence using WordNet senses
* FrameNet
  * semantics-first classification of verbs and nouns
  * Frame: conceptual structure that describe a particular type of situation, object, or event along with participants and props
  * Groups of predicates in same semantic class share case frames
  * eg: Apply-Heat
    * bake, barbecue, blanch, boil, braise, broil, ..., poach, roast, saute
    * Nadia [fried] the sliced onions in a skillet
      * [COOK] [ACTION] [FOOD] [HEATING INSTRUMENT]
