* mapping from case to grammatical function is regular (in English but not 1-1)
  * Subject: nominative/subjective
  * Object: accusative/objective
  * Object of preposition: accusative/objective
* Mapping from grammatical function to thematic role is regular
  * subject ~ agent/experiencer
  * object ~ theme
  * object of preposition ~ goal/location/recipient/instrument
* this is grammatical function
* latter mapping used to determine semantic representaation
* parsing is good at finding grammatical function but not thematic role.
* eg. accusative case is used for a lot of things
* linking: mapping grammatical function to thematic role
* Verb subcategorization
  * Constraints on individual verbs and their complements are not at all regular!
  * C-selection!!
  * Nouns with subcategorization frames are often derived from nouns
  * *Nadia said Ross to sit down
  * Nadia told Ross to sit don
  * we can't predict the regularities of c-selection (subcategorization frames)
  * however if we can find out one or two subcategorization frames we can often infer other frames
  * "default" frame that can be transformed into another frame by moving arguments around: *diathesis*
* Passivization/passive diathesis
  * Consider the example
    1. The goalie kicked the ball
      * `kick (agent=goalie, theme=ball)`
    2. The ball was kicked
      * `kick (agent=?, theme=ball)`
    3. The ball was kicked by the goalie 
      * `kick (agent=goalie, theme=ball)`
  * If (1) is admissible then often structures like (2) are often permisible
  * While agent is unknown, thematic role has not changed! 
  * Existential passive: There exists an agent A such that the ball was kicked by A
  * We can move the agent into a [PP by _] as in (3) without changing semantic representation.
  * Case morphology, grammatical function changes but not semantics
* Diathesis: semantic invariant representation of a sentence
  * want to show that we have a representation of a sentence invariant to syntax or morphological changes
## Lexical semantics
* word meanings and internal structure
* we want a structure of relations among words and meanings
* CL research on lexical semantics
  * word senses, variations on word meanings
  * lexical representations/vectors
  * organization of senses
  * no one really wants to read a dictionary
    * dictionaries are for people not computers
* Entry format
  * Sense (meaning). 
    * Surface form: Orthography, phonology
    * Syntax: Part of speech, morphology, subcategorization
    * Behaviour, uage: Collocations, register, genre
  * We may need to document some exceptions, like dutch plurals (children, brethren, oxen [-ren])
  * Idioms, "to kick the bucket" <=> "to die"
* Word sense
  * grounded in world knowledge
  * are they defined and fixed?
  * two schools
    * sense is built from elements of a set of **universal primitives of meaning** regardless of language (**constructional**)
      * "people cause things to happen"
      * "things die"
      * hence we can express the concept of kill = cause + die
    * sense is distinguished from others by a set of ad hoc **differentia**
      * we don't really know the sense in a vacuum, but we can differentiate 2 senses when compared
      * what is the difference between murder and kill?
        * perhaps murder precludes justification
        * we can talk about "justified killing"
      * can be done with the same word with different senses
        * swim: locomotion from a to b, or swim: to remain floating, treading water
* synonomy
  * Two different (or more words) having the same meaning
    * what does it mean for 2 different words to mean the same thing?
    * looking in the dictionary is not good enough
    * we need a 
* Homonymy, polysemy
  * Two or more meanings having the same word (homonym, polyseme)
    * Lexical ambiguity
  * homography: Same spelling
    * bank for money, bank of river, bank of switches
    * bass fish, bass guitar
    * bow to the audience, tie a bow
  * homophony
    * wood, would
    * weather, whether
    * you, ewe, you
    * bough, bow
  * polysemy: meanings are related
    * run: of humans, rivers, buses, bus routes
    * line: of people, of type, drawn on paper, transit route
  * often no clear line between polysemy and homonym
  * Sense modultion by context
    * fast train, fast typist, fast road
  * Systematic polysemy
    * bank as a financial institution and building
      * one of these senses extend the other sense
    * window as in hole in wall or what fits in hole
    * applies to most or all senses of certain semantic classes
  * Hyponomy, hyperonymy: subtype and supertype
    * sedan is a hyponym of car
* Without context, we can not know what "bank" means
