* syntax taggers
* reference resolution
* parts of speech tagging
* translate semantic representations into natural language
* vauqois triangle
  * instead of going from natural lang to language independent semantic representation to natural lang, go from NL->NL
* current systems based purely on statistical associations
* MTL does not use parsing or generation
* CL systems
  * info extraction
  * chunking
    * partial parse
    * grabs some semantic and syntactic structure
  * template filling
  * named-entity recognition
    * able to identity proper nouns
    * companies, people, commodities
* lexical semantics
  * word sense disambiguation
    * determines by context 
  * taxonomies of word senses/meaning
  * embedding words into continuous vector embeddings
    * word2vec, BERL, XLNET
    * assign a family of vectors to a word, one for each meaning
  * analysis of verbs and other predicates
* understanding is hard
  * structures we are interested in are hierarchical
  * syntax trees
  * "Nadia knows Ross left" -> `KNOWS(Nadia, LEFT(Ross))`
* surface to form is many-to-many
  * "Nadia kisses Ross" <=> "Ross is kissed by Nadia" <=> "Nadia gave Ross a kiss" <=> "Nadia gave a kiss to Ross"
  * represent `KISS(Nadia, Ross)`
* ambiguity at all levels
  * lexical
    * The lawyer walked to the bar and...
      * address the jury
      * ordered a beer
    * You held your breath and the door for me
  * syntactic
    * Nadia saw the cop with the binoculars
      * [Nadia [saw [the cop [with [the binoculars]]]]]
      * [Nadia [saw [the cop] [with the binoculars]]]
    * garden path sentences
    * most syntactic ambiguity is local, resolve by semantic or syntactic context
      * Visiting relatives is trying/Visiting relatives are trying
      * Nadia saw the cop with the gun
    * Sometimes resolution comes too fast
      * The cotton clothing is made from comes from Missisipi
        * humans can't really parse this sentence
    * computational issues
      * combinatorial structure
      * syntactic preferences
      * incremental parsing
  * pragmatic
    * Representing beliefs 
      * N: Do you know who's going to the party?
      * E: Who?
      * N: I don't know
      * E: Oh... I think Carol and Amy will be there
    * computational issues
      * represents issues and beliefs
      * planning and plan recognition
      * inferencing and diagnosis
    * need for domain knowledge
* focus of this class
  * grammars and parsing
  * resolving syntactic ambiguity
  * determine argument structure
  * lexical semantics, resolving word-sense ambiguities
  * compositional semantics
  * understanding pronouns
