* Syntactic sources of ambiguity
  * Derived from PoS ambiguity
    * "Time flies"
  * Attachment of one phrase to another
    * often attaching a  PP 
    * "examined the fingerprint with the microscope"
    * "the horse in the barn that the vet examined"
  * Gap ambiguities
    * "the boys that the police debate about fighting"
  * NN compounds
    * "winter boot sale"
    * "airport long term car park courtesy vehicle pickup point"
  * alternative semantic role of subconstituent
    * between complementized clauses and relative clauses
    * "The tourist objected to the guide that they couldn't hear"
* we look at human behaviour to find out how to resolve these
  * minimal attachment -- prefer the simplest structure
    * Karen knew the schedule {1. by heart | 2. was wrong (requires parse 2, needs longer processing time)}
      1. [S [NP [PN Karen]] [VP [V Knew [NP the schedule]]]]
      2. [S [NP [PN Karen]] [VP [V Knew [S [NP the schedule]]]]]
   * recency (local/right association) -- associate new input with most recent part of the parse treee
     * Karen met the mother of a single who...
       1. [NP the mother [PP [P of] [NP a singer [S who]]]] 
       2. [NP the mother [PP [P of] [NP a singer]] [S who]]
    * this might contradict minimal attachment  
  * Lexical preferences
    * words (mostly verbs) have defaults for their containing nearby structures
    * The tourists { objected | signalled } to the guide that they { couldn't hear | didn't like }
      1. Prefer AGENT object to PATIENT
         1. AGENT object to PATIENT MESSAGE also possible 
      2. Prefer AGENT signal to PATIENT MESSAGE
         1.  AGENT signal to PATIENT is also possible
    * Might contradict minimal attachment or recency 
      * Resign to looking at statistical approach :(
    * That they "didn't like" needs an argument to be a complement clause, but there is no direct object
      * There is a gap after [didn't like] that is filled with 'the guide'
    * PP attachment
      * Preposition `p` to be attached to a verb
      * Verb `v` prefers PP with preps `p1`, `p2` or nouns `n1` `n2`
    * Preferences are only preferences
      * Might not be satisfiable
      * Might conflict
      * Might be overriden with coherence, plausibility, world knowledge
      * May not have strong preferences one way or another
    * If a word `w` had some preferences
      * How would we know what they are
        * Corpus-based attachment disambiguation
          * Gather statistics for lexical usages
          * Corpus gives preferred structure
          * Corpus needs to be manually annotated
          * Corpus bias, rare linguistic phenomena may not appear in corpus (sparse data)
          * Required information may not be explicit in corpus
          * Use corpus statistics to train an algorithm
            * classify V-attachment or NP-attachment
            * Given input (V, NP, PP), should PP attach to V or NP?
            * three way partition of corpus data
              * training data
              * development (validation, verification data)
                * tests successive versions of algorithm under development
                * guide adjustments to approach
              * test data
                * testing final version of algorithm
                * no more tweaking allowed
                * can not touch the algorithm
        * Copora with grammars
          * treat corpora themselves as means of specifying grammars
            * phrase-structure rules are grounded in data
          * conventional view is to use counts to estimate numerical parameters of prior grammars
        * Statistics used to numerically estimate the parameters of a model
        * Apply model to new cases
      * How to apply in a parser?
  * PP ambiguity
    * Sometimes requires complex world knowledge
      * "Optimal anisotropy of the copolyester melts can be determined by **examination of the materials _with_** the use of an optical microscope
        * WITH attaches to EXAMINATION
      * This is the first **examination of the material _with_** the impurity CVL in the region of deeply core shells
        * WITH attaches with MATERIAL
      * The kinetic advantage arising upon using the NAH/Al mixture to prepare the doped hydride was well reproduced in our **examination of the materials _with_** variable dopant amounts and preparation conditions
        * WITH attaches to ??? (EXAMINATION | MATERIALS | REPRODUCED)
        * Only known if you are a chemist to have the context to resolve the attachment
  * Truly unambiguous rephrasals/unambiguous cases
    * I saw the man with the telescope / The man with the telescope saw me
    * The signals were analyzed with the oscilloscope
      * There is no way to fill the gap in any other way
      * "I analyzed the signals with the oscilloscope" 
  * Sometimes there are real syntactical constraints, must be able to say "no"
  * Often, syntax can say probably not
    * Preposition 'of' rarely attaches to transitive verb
    * Strong contraints on attaching PP to pronouns and proper names
    * "he examined john with a stethoscope"
