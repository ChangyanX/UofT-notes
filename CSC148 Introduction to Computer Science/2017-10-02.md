**Problem 1**: Given the _duration_ of flights, find the route from city *A*, to city *B* with least overall _flight time_

**Problem 2**: Given the _cost_ of flights, find the route from city *A* to city *B* with the least _overall cost_

and etc. with different properties. 

**Problem 5**: Given the *rules of a game*, find the *fastest* way to win.

## Abstract Data Type
* Defines data and operations
* Does not define an implementation
* A structure common between programming languages

**Example ADTs**
* Dictionary
* Queue
* PriorityQueue

If a language does not have an ADT in it's stdlib, you can write it yourself.

### Stack ADT
**Operations**
* Push
* Pop
* Check if Empty

Can be abstracted further as a **Container ADT**.

#### Uses
* Function stack frames are on a stack
* Balancing parentheses:
  * Push symbols until a closing bracket, then pop symbols until a matching opening bracket.

**Which side is the "top" of the stack?**
We need to specify if the top of the stack is at the end of the list, or at the beginning of the list.
