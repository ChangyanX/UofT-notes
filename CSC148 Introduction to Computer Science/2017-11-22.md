## Collection ADT
* BSTs can implement the *Collection* ADT
* Data: 0 or more items
* Order or insertion has no bearing on deletion/retrival 
* Operations:
  * Insert
  * Search (By Value)
  * Delete (By Value)

* Sorted Python List
* Linked List
* BST
 
#### Sorted python list
* Cost of sorting
* Efficiency of Search
  * O(log n)
* Efficiency of insertion
  * worst: O(n)
* Efficency of deletion
  * O(n)

#### Linked List
* Cost of sorting
  * Unsorted
  * Won't speed up search due to links.
  * Access is O(n) anyways.
* Search 
  * O(n)
* Insert
  * O(1)
* Delete
  * O(n)

#### Balanced BST
* Search
  * O(log n)
* Insertion
  * O(log n) (nodes = height of tree)
* Deletion
  * O(log n)


BST provides best of both worlds, only *if* the tree is balanced!
