Linked List III

Getting an item by index

```python
curr = self._first
curr_index = 0

# lecture algo
while curr is not None and curr_index < index:
  curr = curr.next
  curr_index += 1 

# algo without index
for _ in range(index): # loop index times.
  curr = curr and curr.next 
  # curr will shortcircuit if None, and hence by the semantics of the and function, will return None.
  # see PEP505 for justification of this (ab)use of the and operator.

# Know either curr is None, or curr_index == index.
# Assert this and get Python to confirm.

assert (curr is None) or (curr_index == index)

if curr is None: # if not curr would work here too, taking advantage of falsy values.
  raise IndexError

return curr

```

Inserting
```python
def insert(self, index: int, item: object) -> None:
"""
Insert an item in between or at the end of the linked list.
"""
  if index > len(self) or index < 0:
    raise IndexError

  if index is 0:
    next_node = self._first # next_node could be None.
    # [_first] -> _first + k 
    # OR 
    # None
    self._first = Node(item, next_node) # i.e _first.next = next_node
    # Now we have:
    # [new _first] -> [_first] -> _first + k
    # [new _first] -> None
    assert self._first is not None
    return 
  
  # self._first can not be none here, since index != 0, index > 0, and len(self) > 0.
  assert self._first not None
  
  prev_node = self._first
  for _ in range(index - 1):
    prev_node = prev_node.next
  
  # Since we know the index <= len(self), all nodes must exist at this point.
  assert prev_node is not None
  
  new_node = Node(item, prev_node.next) # i.e new_node.next = prev_node.next 
  # We make new_node reference the same next value as the previous node.
  # Now:
  # new_node -> prev_node + k
  # prev_node -> prev_node + k
  prev_node.next = new_node
  # Make prev_node.next reference new node, inserting it after.
  # prev_node -> new_node -> prev_node + k
```

Deleting an item

```python
def remove(self, item: object) -> None:
"""Remove the first occurrence of <item> in this list. Do nothing if this list does not contain <item>."""
   curr = self._first
   prev = None
   while curr is not None and curr.item is not item: # This will shortcircuit if curr is None.
      prev = curr
      curr = curr.next
  
  # curr is either None, or is item.
  if curr is None:
    return

  # Before: prev -> curr -> curr + 1
  if prev is not None:
    prev.next = curr.next # Remove curr from the chain. 
  else:
    self._first = curr.next
  # After: prev -> curr + 1
```

We have removed curr from the chain.
