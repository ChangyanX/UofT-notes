* `Maybe` is a monad. Our `tryFail :: (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b` method is close to the signature of `(>>=) :: Monad m => m a -> (a -> m b) -> mb`!


```haskell
return :: a -> Maybe a
return = Just -- return is eta-reduced into the type constructor Just.
```

Once `Nothing` is returned, nothing gets evaluated ever.

```haskell
Nothing >>= undefined -- Nothing
```

How it's implemented is pattern matching on `>>=`

```haskell
instance Monad Maybe where
    (>>=) a (Just x) = f x
    (>>=) _ Nothing = Nothing
```

We don't have a way to know when something failed with `Maybe`.

```haskell
do 
    x <- (Maybe a) 
    y <- (Maybe b)
```

We don't know whether something failed at `x` or `y`, since we get `Nothing`.

We can use `Either` to represent a specified error.

```haskell
data Either a b = Left a | Right b
```

By convention a successful computation is represented in the `Right` value, and `Left` is passed through. 

```haskell
Left "a" >>= \x -> Left "b" >>= \x -> Right "c" -- Left "a"
```

This can be seen in the definition of `>>=` for `Either`

```haskell
-- e is passed through.
(>>=) :: Either e a -> (a -> Either e b) -> Either e b
```

Note that `Maybe a` is isomorphic to `Either () a`.

We will use `Either String a` to represent a basic 'exception' type.

`Either` is also a monad, so we can also use `>>=` to access these values. 


```haskell
instance Monad [] where
    return :: a -> [a]
    return = . []

    (>>=) :: [a] -> (a -> [b]) -> [b]
```

The `List` monad can simulate non determinism by representing "any" accumulated value from the list for the natural implementation for `>>=`. 

Compare

```scheme
(+ 3 (-< 1 2 3))
```

with this expression

```haskell
(+ 3) [1 2 3]
```

The Haskell won't type check, instead we need to be more explicit

```haskell
fmap (+ 3) [1, 2, 3]
```

or alternatively

```haskell
(+ 3) <$> [1, 2, 3]
```
