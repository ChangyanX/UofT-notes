# Lambda Calculus

```ebnf
expr = ID
       | "(" "Î»" ID "." expr ")"
       | "(" expr expr ")"
       ;
```

In Haskell it looks like this

```ebnf
expr = ID
        | "\\" ID "->" expr
        | expr expr
        ;
```

Note `"\\"` is an escaped backslash.

What is a program in the lambda calculus?
It is single expression generated from its grammar.

```ebnf
prog = expr;
expr = (* omitted *)
```

What does itr mean to run a program? Lambda calculi are evaluated by substitution.

Consider the evaluation of the identity function: \((\lambda x . x) y \implies y\). We subtitute \(x\) with \(y\).

How can we extend the lambda calculus? Consider built in data types, etc. numbers.

### Y-combinator

We don't actually need name binding to express recursion.

### `let*`

In Racket, we can create a local scope with `let*`

```lisp
(let * ([x1 1]
        [y1 3]
        [x2 10]
        [y2 -1]
        [dx (-x1 x2)]
        [dy (-y1 y2)])
    (sqrt (+ (* dx dx) (* dy dy))))
```

## Function Call Evaluation

We have no way to express *side effects* in function evaluation, since we only substitute values to evaluate.

We can't *mutate an argument*, or *perform any IO* such as `print` or `open`.

**Referential trnspency** is a name that can be replacd with its values everywhere.

## Structural Recursion

An algorithm design where structured input data is decomposed into subcompnents with the same structure.

ex. a list is either an empty list, or an item concatenated with another list.

```haskell
data [] a = [] | a : [a]
```

Or alternatively

```haskell
data List = nil | Cons a (List a)
```
