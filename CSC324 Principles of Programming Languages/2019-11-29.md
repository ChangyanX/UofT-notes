* Write a program that takes a filename and string, and prints all lines of the file that begin with that string.
  ```haskell
  main :: IO ()
  main = 
    do
      filename <- ...
      contents <- readFile filename
      let allLines = lines contents
      map putStrLn take 50 allLines
  ```

  This won't work, since we don't want a list of IO actions, but one single IO action that represent all the actions.

  (Recall `procesAll` from the exercises.)

  ```haskell
  main :: IO ()
  main = 
    do
      args <- getArgs -- IO action that gets the IO arguments. 
      contents <- readFile $ head args
      let allLines = lines contents
          filteredLines = filter (isPrefixOf $ args !! 1) allLines 
      traverse_ putStrLn $ take 50 allLines
  ```

  `traverse_` ignores the result of the computation. `traverse` collects the results.

  For historical reasons, there is `mapM` / `mapM_` which is aliased to `traverse` / `traverse_`. `traverse_` is not available in Prelude, but can be imported from `Data.Foldable`.

  `getArgs` does not include the name of the executable.

* **Imperative shell**, **functional core**. The idea is to separate the IO based interactions from the pure functions.
* 
  ```haskell
  filterLines :: String -> String -> [String]
  filterLines prefix contents = filter (isPrefixOf prefix) $ lines contents 

  main :: IO ()
  main = 
    do
      args <- getArgs -- IO action that gets the IO arguments. 
      contents <- readFile $ head args
      traverse_ putStrLn $ take 50 filterLines (args !! 1) contents
  ```

  And in point-free style

  ```haskell
  filterLines :: String -> String -> [String]
  filterLines = (. lines) . filter . isPrefixOf

  main :: IO ()
  main = 
    do
      args <- getArgs -- IO action that gets the IO arguments. 
      contents <- readFile $ head args
      traverse_ putStrLn $ take 50 filterLines (args !! 1) contents
  ```

* Type inference
  * Determining types statically without type annotations
  * Diamond operator in Java `<>`, then `var`
  * Haskell
  * ```haskell
    words :: String -> [String]
    (!!) :: [a] -> Int -> a

    f x y = (words x) !! y
    ```
    See `(words x)` implies `x :: String`, and `words x :: [String]`
    The indexing function is generic, but since `words x :: [String]`, this forces `(!!) (words x) :: Int -> String`
