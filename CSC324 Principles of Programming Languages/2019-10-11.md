We can implement `and`, `or`, and `cond` in terms of `if` using a macro. Since macros don't evaluate arguments, we can implement these as macros.

## Streams (and lazy lists)
Suppose we have a large collection of data, where eager evaluation isn't an option. It's impractical to load all the data into memory. We can also use the same approach for some slow input, like user input or chunked files.

Examples
* HTML long polling
* Chunked parsing
* Python range
* Large files
* Delayed input

A Python list is not a list constructor: It doesn't create a new list. Consider `range(0, 100000)`, is still constant time: a generator. Note, in Python 2, `range` created a list, so we used `xrange`.

A **stream** is an abstract model of a sequence of values over time.

### Lazy lists
A lazy list is a stream implementation based on lists.

It is a 
* Empty stream
* Cons another lazy list.
```haskell
data List a = Empty | Cons a (List a)
```

In Racket we can implement something similar like this.

```scheme
(define empty-stream 'empty)
(define (stream-empty? stream) (equal stream empty-stream))

(define-syntax stream-cons
 (syntax-rules ()
   [(stream-cons <first-expr> <rest-expr>)
    (cons (thunk <first-expr>) (thunk <rest-expr>))]))

(define (stream-first stream) ((car stream)))
(define (stream-rest stream) ((cdr stream)))
```

Notice that the `cdr` and `car` expressions have two sets of parens; first parens calls `cdr` or `car`, then second evaluates the thunk

In Haskell, all lists are already lazy!.

```haskell
x = (error "Error") : [2, 3, 4]
tail x -- [2, 3, 4] We skip the first element! It is not eval'd
head x -- "Exception: 'Error'"
length x -- 4 No need to evaluate list contents.
map (\x -> x + 1000) x -- x is strict in map, so there is an error...
map (\x -> 1000) x -- x is not strict in map so this does not error.
y = map (\x -> x + 1000) -- name bindings are lazy.
```
## Production and consumption of data.

Streams are a way to decouple production and consumption of data.

```python
i = 0
while i < 1000:
    f(i)
    i += 1
```

The data being consumed here is the range `[0 ... 999]`. The production of data here is coupled with the computation: producing the range is in the same body as `f`. 

What if we flip the lines?


```python
i = 0
while i < 1000:
    i += 1
    f(i)
```

This greatly changes the behaviour of the loop.

```python
for i in range(0, 1000):
    f(i)
```
This code is "less coupled", we don't have to worry about "producing" the data, or `i` changing out from underneath for us.

```haskell
range :: Integer -> Integer -> [Integer]
range start end
    | start >= end = []
    | otherwise = start : range (start + 1) end
```

What if we do 

```haskell
range' :: Integer -> [Integer]
range' start = start : range' (start + 1)
```
There is no end to the sequence of numbers! 

```haskell
take 4 $ range' 100
```

## Bisection method
By the IVT, if we have two functions where one is negative, and one positive, there exists a midpoint where it is 0.

Bisection method is binary search to find this midpoint.

```python
def bisect(f, tol, a, b):
    c = (a + b) / 2
    while abs(f(c)) >= tol:
        if (sign(f(a)) == sign(f(c))):
            a = c
        else: 
            b = c
        c = (a + b) / 2
    return c
```

Where `tol` is the tolerance close to 0. This is just an approximation.

In Haskell, we instead use tail recursion

```haskell
-- | Tail recusive bisection method.
bisect :: (Double -> Double) -> Double -> Double -> Double -> Double
bisect f tol a b 
    | abs y < tol = c
    | signum (f a) == signum y = bisect f tol c b
    | otherwise = bisect f tol a c
    where c = (a + b) / 2
          y = f c
```

How do we want to debug this? What if instead we have a stream of bisections.

```haskell
bisections :: (Double -> Double) -> Double -> Double -> [Double]
bisections f a b
    | signum (f a) == signum y = c : bisections f c b
    | otherwise bisections f a c
    where c = (a + b) / 2
          y = f c
```

We now have access to all of these bisections, and can take what we want.

```haskell
let poly = \x -> (x*x*x) - x*x - 2
    cs = bisections poly 0 2
in 
    print $ head $ filter
