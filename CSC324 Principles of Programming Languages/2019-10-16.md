# 2019-10-16 Ambiguous operator `-<`

The ambiguous operator `-<` represents a non deterministic, *arbitrary* choice of one of its subexpressions. There is a parallel to quantum mechanics and SchrÃ¶dinger's cat.

Consider 

```scheme
(-< 1 2 3) ; 1, 2, or 3
(+ 10 (-< 1 2 3))
```

We can frame this as a 'random' choice, or an arbitrary choice. Computers don't have true non determinism! We can't *exactly* view this as the sum of types `1 | 2 | 3`, depending on the implementation of `-<`

```scheme
> (-< 1 2 3)
1
> (next!)
2
> (next!)
3
```

In this implementation we use the cooperating function `next!` that can be used to access the other values. Compare this to generators in Python that represents a sequence of values.

`next!` looks like it's a function, but it's **impure**, since it returns different inputs for every call. In Racket, the convention is to use exclamation marks to mark impurity.

**The linearity of this implementation is an implementation detail!** We can just as well return a random value instead of the items ambiguously.


`-<` and `next!` are implemented as a self-modifying stream.

```scheme
(define choices (void))
(define (set-choices! val) (set! choices val))
```

**DO NOT DO THIS**. For simplicity's sake we use global variables to implement this. `set!` rebinds an existing binding and changes it's value. This is inherently impure!!

We don't want the evaluation of `-<` to be eager, so it must be a macro in Racket.

```scheme
(define-syntax -<
 (syntax-rules ()
   [(-< <expr1>)
     (begin
      (set-choices! (void))
      <expr1>)]
   [(-< <expr1> <expr2> ...)
     (begin
        (set-choices! (thunk (-< <expr2> ...)))
            <expr1>)]))
```

```scheme
(define DONE 'done)
(define (next!)
  (if void? choices
    DONE
    (choices)))
```
Notice that we save the remaining choices inside the global variable `choices`, then return the first expression. Order matters here to pattern match. 

Note that while `next!` appears pure, the mutation happens in `set-choices!`. Again, **the linearity of `-<` is an implementation detail**. For simplicity we have this.

If we have two different choice expressions at the same time, one will be overwritten.

```scheme
(+ 10 (-< 1 2 3)); 11
```

Will this work with the current implementation? What's stored in `choices` is the choices!

```scheme
(next!) ; 2
```

We use **continuations** to solve this problem. That is, we need to store the execution context as well: `(+ 10 _)`.

The **execution context** of an expression is a representation of what remains to be computer *after* the expression is evaluated. That is, *what happens after you make a choice*. We also call this a **continuation**.


The continuation of an expression is represented by the *state of the call stack* after the expression has been evaluated, in a traditional imperative programming language. C actually has `setjmp` and `longjmp` that can save the state of the call stack!

In functional programming, the **continuation** is a unary function derived from the enclosing expression.

Some examples for the expression `(+ (* 2 3) (- 5 4))`

|Subexpression|Continuation|Lambda Syntax|
|---|---|---|
|`3`|`(+ (* 2 _) (- 5 4)`|`(lambda (x) (+ 2 x) (- 5 4)`|
|`(* 2 3)`|`(+ _ (- 5 4)`|`(lambda (x) (+ x (- 5 4)`|
|`5`|`(+ 6 (- _ 4)`|`(lambda (x) (+ 6 (- _ 4)`|
|`+`|`(_ 6 4)`|`(lambda (x) (x 6 4)`|
|`(+ (* 2 3) (- 5 4))`|`_`|`(lambda (x) x)`|

Racket allows us to compute continuations.
```scheme
(shift <id> <body>)
```
`shift` binds the **enclosing continuation to `<id>`**, then evaluates `<body>` **with `<id>` in scope**, then **discards the enclosing the continuation, returning the result of `<body>`**


```scheme
(require racket/control)
(+ 10 (shift k 1)) ; k == (+ 10 _)
; 1
```

`shift` can be thought of as `return`, or `break`; some type of interrupt that halts evaluation and returns the innermost expression.

Consider this shift expression, this result returns 11.

```scheme
(require racket/control)
(+ 10 (shift k (k 1))) ; k == (+ 10 _)
; 11
```

What if we save `k` for later use?

```scheme
(define cont (void))
(+ 10 (shift k 
        (set! cont k)
        (k 1)))
```
Then `(cont 1000)` is `1010`.

We can use `shift` to fix our problem with the ambiguous operator.


```scheme
(define-syntax -<
 (syntax-rules ()
    ; Unit
   [(-< <expr1>)
     (begin
      (set-choices! (void))
      <expr1>)]
    ; Product
   [(-< <expr1> <expr2> ...)
; note that shift allows us to have multiple bodies expressions.
     (shift k 
; thunk wraps calling of continuation of the syntax.
        (set-choices! (thunk (k (-< <expr2> ...))))
            <expr1>)]))
```
