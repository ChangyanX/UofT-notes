* IO Monad 
  * how do we interact with the outside world?
  * treat outside world as giant mutable state
  * ```haskell
    getLine :: World -> (String, World)
    putStrLn :: String -> World -> ((), World)
    ``` 
    reading from stdin changes the state!

    printing also changes the state

    ```haskell
    readFile :: String -> World -> (String, World)
    writeFile :: String -> String -> World -> ((), World)
    openFile :: String -> Mode -> World -> (FileHandle, World)
    hClose :: FileHandle -> World -> ((), World)
    ```

    importantly we have a concept of old world and new world.

    This is true for all types of IO

    ```haskell
    spawnCommand :: String -> World -> (ProcessHandle, World)
    networkRequest :: Request -> World -> (Maybe Response, World)
    ```

* We can write this as `State`
    ```haskell
    State World a = State (World -> (a, World))
    ```

* However `World` isn't a real data structure. Instead we have `IO`
  * `data IO a` which is a primitive. It's not implemented in "pure" Haskell.
* syscalls look like C function calls but are different in implementations.
* `IO` operations look like `State` interactions but are implemented with syscalls.
* ```haskell
  getLine :: IO String
  putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
  ```
* Consider this code
  ```
  x = putStrLn "Hello World"
  ```
  `x` represents the computation of outputting "Hello World" to stdout, not the actual action of outputting.
* An `IO` action is executed only in two situations
  * Evaluated in `ghci`
  * Evaluated in `main` when the program is run.
* How do we chain IO actions?
  * With `State`, we have `runState`
  * With `Maybe`, we can pattern match
  * With `List`, we had `concatMap`.
* Monads didn't add to the computational power, it was just an abstraction.
* For `IO`, we only have the `Monad` instance.  


* `IO` is the ultimate lack of constraints. `main` can do **anything**
* Recall generic polymorphism
  ```haskell
  f :: a -> a
  f x = x
  ```
  ```csharp
  T f<T>(T x) {
      Console.WriteLine("Hello World")
      return x
  }
  ```

  If we have `IO`, this is no longer true.
  ```haskell
  f :: a -> IO a
  f x = 
    do
        putStrLn "Hello World"
        return x
  ```

  In other programming languages, the `IO` is everywhere and always.

  We can view `State s`, `Maybe` and `IO` as computational contexts that extend pure functional programming. 

  Once we're in a context, it's "hard" to extract the contained value.

  For `IO`, it's basically impossible*. There's no function of type `IO a -> a` (*`unsafePerformIO`).

  So, if one part of the function is `IO`, the entire function is an `IO` action.

* Consider
  ```haskell
  f :: Integer -> String
  f n = 
    let input = getLine
    in 
        take n input
  ```
  This will not compile!
  ```haskell
  f :: Integer -> IO String
  f n = do
    input <- getLine
    return $ take n input
  ```
