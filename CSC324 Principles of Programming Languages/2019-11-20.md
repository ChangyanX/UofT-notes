* `null` values are usually runtime errors, is there an approach we can use to move this into the type system?
  * signaling on error (try/catch)
  * in haskell types are non-null -- `... -> T` can't return `null`, but in other languages many languages `null` typechecks with anything.
  * We use the `Maybe` type to encode the possibility of failure
    ```haskell
    data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
    ```
    Note that `Just "Hello World" == "Hello World"` won't even evaluate, because the type of `Maybe a` is different from `a`. We need to be able to handle the possibility of failure when we have an instance of type `Maybe a`. 

    Instead of falling down to the 'pyramid of doom' by matching the `Nothing` at each level, we can use the monad instance.

    Instead of 

    ```haskell
    case lookup user1 scores of
         Nothing -> Nothing
         Just scores1 ->
            case safeHead scores1 of
                Nothing -> Nothing
                Just scores2 ->
                    ...
    ```
    we can instead do, since `Maybe` is a monad...
    ```haskell
    lookup user1 scores >>= \scores1 -> 
        safeHead scores1 >>= \scores2 ->
            ...
    ```

    ```haskell
    do
        scores1 <- lookup user1 scores1
        scores2 <- safeHead scores1
        ...
    ```

    which returns `Maybe a`.
