What if `my-class` is a function?
```scheme
(my-class Point (x y))
```
`x` and `y` would be eagerly evaluated, causing an unbound error.

## Syntax vs. runtime errors.

A pattern-based macro can one of three results
1. No patterns match the expression
2. Pattern matches but the expanded expression is semantically invalid
   1. This is a syntax error
3. A pattern matches and the expanded expression is semantically valid

Consider the expansion of this macro

```scheme
(my-class (+ 3 4) (x y))
```

This isn't a problem of the macro, but we didn't identify the preconditions of the macro.


## AST-based vs. text-based macros
In Racket, macros work on the AST. In C, macros work in text. This is quite dangerous. 

1. Expression structure is not preserved.
    ```c
    #define double(x) 2*x
    int main(void) {
        int a = 10;
        printf("%d\n", double(100));
        printf("%d\n", double(a + a));
    }
    ```

    Then if we expand the macro, on line 4
    ```c
        printf("%d\n", 2 * a + a); // this is a semantically wrong result!
    ```

    If we define the macro in parentheses, we can get a more hygenic result.
    ```c
    #define double(x) (2*(x))
    ```
    Then the expansion is
    ```c
        printf("%d\n", (2 * (a + a)));
    ```

    We need to do some more work to ensure the structure of the code is preserved when expanding the macro

2. Name capture
    ```c
    #define swap(a, b) int temp = a; a = b; b = temp;
 
    int main(void) {
        int x = 0, y = 10;
        swap(x, y)
        swap(x, y)
    }
    ```
    The issue here is subtle; in macro expansion `temp` will be defined twice.
    ```c
    int temp = x; x = y; y = temp;
    int temp = x; x = y; y = temp;
    ```
    Multiple uses of swap will affect the semantics.
    We can get around this in C by creating a new scope
    ```c
    #define swap(a, b) { int temp = a; a = b; b = temp; }
    ```
    Then the expansion is as such
    ```c
    { int temp = x; x = y; y = temp; }
    { int temp = x; x = y; y = temp; }
    ```
    But this macro won't work for any variable named temp, outside of the macro scope! The name is captured by the macro!
    ```c
    { int temp = x; x = temp; temp = temp; }
    ```
    We can only fix this by using naming conventions.
    ```c
    #define swap(a, b) { int __SWAP__temp = a; a = b; b = __SWAP__temp; }
    ```

Compare this to Racket macros

```scheme
(define-syntax defs (syntax-rules ()
    [(defs)
        (begin
            (define x 1)
            (define y (+ x 10))
            (+ x y))]))
```

Multiple calls to `(defs)` are hygenic, Racket will do automatic renaming of variables! Lexical scope is preserved!

However consider `my-class` allows us to bind identifiers too the outer scope.

```scheme
(my-class Point (x y))
(my-class Point (x y z))
```

Anything that the user passes in is ok.

## Pattern matching in macros


```scheme
(define-syntax my-class
 (syntax-rules ()
   [
; Pattern. Note use of rest operator to collect attributes into attr.
     (my-class <class-name> (<attr> ...)
        (method (<method-name> <param> ...)
            <body>) ...) 
; Template. Note that the rest operator here is a spread, not first and rest.
     (define (<class-name> <attr> ...)
      (let* ([__dict__
        (make-immutable-hash
; Rest operator here spreads the cons expression for all attributes collected in attr.
          (list (cons (quote <attr>) <attr>) ... 
                (cons (quote <method-name>)
                        (lambda (<param> ...) <body>)) ...
            ))])
          (lambda (msg)
            (hash-ref __dict__ msg
              (attribute-error (quote <class-name>) msg)
                ))))]))
```

The new additions of the `method` pattern allow us to define methods. Notice the use of elipses in the `method` pattern to match one or more method patterns.

```scheme
(my-class Point (x y)
    (method (scale factor)
        (Point (* x factor) (* y factor))))
```

What happens if we match properly but use the wrong syntax?

```scheme
(my-class Point (x y)
    (not-method (scale factor)
        (Point (* x factor) (* y factor))))
```

This matches fine, because it matches on `method` as an identifier.

This is what the first argument of `syntax-rules` takes.

```scheme
(syntax-rules (method) ; this causes method to be matched as a literal!
    ...)
```
Then `not-method` will result in a syntax error
