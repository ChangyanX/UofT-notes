# 2019-10-18 Ambiguous Operator Part 2

Recall the previous implementation of `(next!)`

After calling the continuation

```scheme
(* 100 (-< 1 2 3)) ; 100
```
Because the continuation was saved previously
```scheme
(+ 3 (next!)) ; 203 Ok
(next!) ; 303 (???)
```

After evaluating `(* 100 (-< 1 2 3))`, we have choices
```scheme
(thunk ((* 100 _)
    (-< 2 3)))
```

Where the `-<` expands into 

```scheme
(shift k
    (set-choices! (thunk (k (-< 3)))
    (k 2)))
```

Since `shift` depends on where it is evaluated! `choices` captures its entire enclosing continuation!

We need to use `reset` to limit the scope of `shift`, a type of 'barrier' that limits the effect of a shift.

```scheme
(reset <body>)
```
Returns the result of `<body>`, but any `shift` inside the `<body>` only captures and disregards continuations up to the `reset`. (Compare to React error-boundaries)

```scheme
(+ 10 (shift k 3)) ; 3 (remember the expression (+ 10 _) is moved into k. The result of the evaluation of this expression is 3)

(+ 10 (reset (shift k 3))) ; 13 (shift can not move (+ 10 _) into k, because it is stopped by reset.)
```

Hence our new definition of `next!` to prevent `shift` from leaking.

```scheme
(define DONE 'done)
(define (next!)
  (if void? choices
    DONE
    (reset (choices))))
```

When `next!` returns `DONE`, we want to immediately return `DONE`. How do we `discard` the current continuation? Currently we evaluate `'done` as a value in the outer expression causing weird bugs.


```scheme
(define DONE 'done)
(define (next!)
  (if void? choices
    (shift k DONE) ; Discards the continuation, returning 'done immediately.
    (reset (choices))))
```

What happens in 
```
(+ (-< 1 2) (-< 10 20))
```

The problem here is that both ambiguous expressions want to write to `choices`

Our solution here is to make `choices` hold a collection of thunks.

One such is a stack based implementation.
```scheme
(define choices null)
(define (add-choice! c) (push! choices c))
(define (get-choice!) (pop! choices))
```

```scheme
(define-syntax -<
 (syntax-rules ()
    ; Unit
   [(-< <expr1>)
     <expr1>] ; no longer needed to init choices
    ; Product
   [(-< <expr1> <expr2> ...)
; note that shift allows us to have multiple bodies expressions.
     (shift k 
; thunk wraps calling of continuation of the syntax.
        (add-choices! (thunk (k (-< <expr2> ...))))
            (k <expr1>))]))
```



```scheme
(define DONE 'done)
(define (next!)
  (if void? choices
    (shift k DONE) ; Discards the continuation, returning 'done immediately.
    (reset (get-choice!))))
```

Then `next!` will pop the most recently added thunk! The continuation that's captured is left to right.

After a f

```scheme
(+ (-< 1 2) (-< 10 20)) ; 11
(next!) ; 21
; Then the next thunk is
'(thunk ((+ _) (-< 10 20)) (-< 2))
(next!) ; 12 (+ 2 (-< 10 20))
(next!) ; 22
```

Note that these options are explored depth first. Branching on 1 2, then 10 20. The **order matters**, because `next!` is implemented as a stack.
