# 2018-09-18 Orientalism

- Orientalism
- politics of representation
- politics of recognition
- comparatice, transational, relational
- interconnectivity

- Edward Said observes in *Orientalism* that there is a marked difference on views of the *Orient* and the *Occident*
- "Orient" is seen as inferior, exotic, despotic, immoral, corrupt, feminized/emasculated, irrational, **Lacks ability to change**, and **Unable to represent themselves**.
- "Occident" is seen as superior, democratic, moral, masculine, **Able to transform itself**, **Capable to speak for itself**.
- Inherent bias in the term "Orient".
- "Irrationality" dictates corrupt places such as the Middle East, whereas the Western "rule of law" makes the western world seem more mature, moral.
- Abnormal "Orient" needs guidance from the *normative* Occident.

- Occident often appears as a masculine man, while the Orient men are represented as "effeminate", or improperly masculine.
  - Not what is associated with "normative masculinity".

- Western leadership "justifies", from "orentialism"
  - Invasion
  - Colonialism
  - Imperialism

- Asian societies are consistently depicted as unable to speak for themselves.
  - Need the western world to speak on behalf on them

- If this Orientalist way of thinking continues, then the West must represent the East.

Said asserts 
> Orientalism is a Western style for dominating...
What phenomenon did he have in mind?

> Orientalism is he whole network of interests, inevitably brought to bear on (and therefore always involved in) any occasion when that peculiar entity in 'the Orient' is in question

Some sort of interest, power, inherent bias involved whenever the "Orient" is talked about.

> European culture gained in strength and identity by setting itself off against the Orient as a sort of *surrogate and even underground self*.

Orientalism is not just comparing eastern cultures with west, but involves power, knowledge and domination.

- Is a colonizing discourse.
- European production of the idea of the Orient
- Orientalism is a will of intention to undestand and console and manipulate a different society.

> What are counter strategies to Western-centered orientalism?

How do we debunk, or counter such strategies? For example if one writes that China is a lawless land, is it sufficient to show emperically the Chinese legal system?

If one states that "Japan is a group-oriented society", can that be refuted by showing the individualism of various Japanese people?

Said says that this is not enough, for Orientalism is more to do with how the West sees itsef as superior, moreso than the actual reality of eastern societies.


The representation of the "Orient" as backwards and lawless cements the lawfulness and progress of the western world. The orient is an integral part of European *material* civilization and culture. Orientalism is a **mode of discourse**.

**Orientalism is a viewpoint served to justify domination over the Orient**. Orientalism is not just **stereotypes**, but a superset of viewpoints on East Asia that contrast with Western instututions and often have a bias towards Western civilization as normative.

Can orientalism be applied to other relationships?
- Specificities of orientalism and orientalistic viewpoints due to historic contact with the East.
- Some aspects, but not all can be applied to other relationships
- If it's related to certain geopolitical contexts, aspects can be applies
  - A country or society viewed as "superior" that decides to dominate an "inferior" group of people in a geopolitical context
    - Japanese Empire (same discourse of self/contrast, backwards and modern Japan)
      - Standard, unable to change itself
   - Nazi Germany
     - Jews are inferior, must be lead by the superior Aryan
     - Lebensraum
    - South Korea
      - Orientalist viewpoint of North Korea
      - North Korea needs help to "liberate" themselves

## Legal Orientalism

- Idea that "China suffers from lack of law"
- What is "law", what counts as "law"?
- What is the "rule of law"
- Ideas about Chinese legality, constructed in relation to Euro-American law.

### Comparative vs Transational

- What is trasnational studies?
- Area studies
  - America Studies
  - East Asian Studies
  - African Studies

- Comparative Approach
  - Chinese Studies - "rule of morality in comparison"
  - American Studies - "how is Chinese lawlessness talked about? Immigration, American imperialism"
  - Human Rights as an excuse for American Imperialism
  - Maintains "units" of geopolitical nation states and compares and contrast
- Transnational Approach
  - Employ two modes of analysis concurrently
  - "China is not lawless, but simply different from US Studies"
  - Chinese Studies and American Studies mode of analysis concurrently
  - United State's call for Open Door policy for China, but also enforce strict immigration laws on Chinese immigrants
  - Why do we know US history so well?
  - Geopolitical "units" evolve in tandem and affect each other.
  - Debunking discrete geopolitical units

- Disciplinary Boundaries
  - Consider "Chinese Studies" as an object of study. What happens if such an object changes? 
  - For example, there is a history of US imperialism in China, but it is rarely talked about because it involves
    both Chinese and American boundaries, but such questions can not be asked within simply one discipline.
