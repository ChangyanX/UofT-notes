## CDF Examples
The distribution function of an RV \(X\) is given.
\[
F(x) = \begin{cases}
   0, & x < 0  \\
   \frac{x^3}{2} &, 0 \leq x < 1 \\
   \frac{x}{2} &, 1 \leq x \leq 2 \\
   1 &, x > 2
\end{cases}
\]

Then note the following examples.

a. \(P(X \leq 0.5) = F(0.5)\)
b. \(P(0.5 \leq X \leq 1.5) = P(X \leq 1.5) - P(X > 0.5) = F(1.5) - F(0.5)\)

From a PDF \(f(y)\), to find the CDF \(F(y) = P(Y \leq y)\), we integrate from the lower bound of the support to the quantity of interest \(y\), with respect to a probability \(u\). We then ensure that the properties of the CDF of the function, possibly by splitting it into a piecewise function (ensuring that past the upper bound of the support, the probability is 1).

## Percentile

The \(k^{th}\) percentile \(x_k\) for an RV \(X\) is defined as \(\frac{k}{100} = P(X \leq x_k) = \int_{-\infty}^{x_k} f(x)dx = F(x_k)\)

### Percentile examples

The median of a random variable \(M\) has a PDF \(3m^2, 0 \leq m < 1\). We want to find the 50th percentile, or *median*,  \(M_{0.5}\), or rather, to solve for \(M_{0.5}\) when \(P(M \leq M_{0.5}) = 0.5\).

Integrating \(3m^2\) from \(0 ... M_{0.5}\) results in \(M^3|^{M_{0.5}}_{M =0} = M_{0.5}^3 = 0.5\). Solving for the media, we get that the median value os around 0.7. **This is not a probability**.

## Expected Value

For a continuous RV, 

\[E(X) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x f(x) dx\]

For any real valued function \(g: X \to \mathbb{R}\).

\[E(g(X)) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} g(x) f(x) dx\]

### EV Examples
The PDF an RV \(X\) is given.
\[
F(g) = \begin{cases}
   g &,  0 < g < 1  \\
   2 - g &, 1 \leq g < 2 \\
   0&
\end{cases}
\]

We find \(E(G)\) by \(\int_0^1 g^2 dg + \int_1^2 g(2-g) dg = 1\) 
## Variance

For a continuous RV, 

\[V(X) = E((X - \mu)^2) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (X - \mu)^2 f(x) dx\]

and similar to discrete RVs,

\[V(X) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2\]

### Variance examples

For an RV \(M\) with PDF \(f(m) = 3m^2, 0 \leq m < 1\), we find \(V(M)\ = E(M^2) - E(M)^2 = \int_{0}^{1} (m^2 \cdot 3m^2) dm - \int_0^1 (m \cdot m^2) dm = ...  = 0.037\)




## Continuous distributions

### Uniform distribution

For an continuous RV \(X \in [a, b]\), it has a uniform distribution if it has density function 

\[
f(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{b-a}&, a \leq x \leq b \\ 0 \end{cases}
\]

\(\mu = \frac{b+a}{2}\), \(\sigma^2 = \frac{(b-a)^2}{12}\)

#### Examples
The difficulty of passing a game level \(i\) is uniformly distributed on \(\frac{1}{i}, i + 1\). A player knows she will pass level 1 if \(d < 1.5\), 2 if \(d < 2.25\), and 3 if \(d < 2.75\).

We can simply use geometry to find probabilities, since it is equal to the probability under the curve. 

a. Probability of passing level 1?
\(D_1\) is the diff of level 1. Then since \(D \sim U[1, 2]\), \(P(D < 1.5) = 0.5\).

b. All levels?

Notice that the difficulty is independent.

\(P(D_1 < 1.5) + P(D_2) < 2.25) + P(D_3 < 2.75) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{.25-0.5}{3.0-2.25}...\)

### Exponential distribution
An exponential distribution with mean (interval per count) \(\theta > 0\) or (count per interval) \(lambda > 0\) for a continuous RV \(X\) has PDF. 

\[
f(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{\theta}e^{-\frac{x}{\theta}} = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}&, x \geq 0 \\ 0 \end{cases}
\]

\(\mu = \theta = \frac{1}{\lambda}\), \(\sigma^2 = \theta^2 = \frac{1}{\lambda^2}\). We say either \(X \sim Exp(\theta)\) or \(X \sim Exp(\lambda)\)

#### Examples

For an RV \(X \sim Exp(\theta)\), find the CDF, or \(P(X \leq a)\) for any \(a \in X\)

\(1 - e^{-\frac{x}{\theta}}\)


#### Exponential and Possion

The exponential distribution models the random interval between two consecutive Poisson arrivals.

For example, if there are average 5 accidents per week \(A \sim Pois(5w)\), where \(w\) is the number of weeks. If \(T = \text{Time between two consecutive Poisson occurances}\), then \(T \sim Exp(\theta = \frac{1}{5} \text{ per accident})\)  or equivalently \(T \sim Exp(\lambda = 5 \text{ accidents per week.})\).

**Proof**
> Let \(X_t\) be the time it takes for another Poisson arrival, if an arrival had occurred at \(t\).
> Let \(N_t\) be the number of Poisson arrivals in an interval of length \(t\).
> Then \(N_t \sim Pois(\lambda t)\).
> *Visually, from time \(t\) for duration \(X_t\), \(N_t\) Poisson arrivals will occur*.
> **Want to show** \(P(X_t  \leq x) = 1 - e^{\frac{-x}{\theta}}\)
> \(P(X_t \leq x) = 1 - P(X_t > x)\)
> *In English, from \(t\) to \(t + x\), (which has duration \(X_t\)) there are no arrivals is equivalent to \(P(X_t > x)\)*.
> \(1 - P(N_{t+x} = N_t)\), or that there has not been a new arrival from \(t\) to \(t+x\).
> \(1 - P(N_x = 0)\), and \(N_x \sim Pois(\lambda x)\)
> \(1 - \frac{e^{-\lambda x}}{0!} = 1 - e^{-\lambda x}\)
> Thus \(X_t \sim Exp(\lambda)\) 
> \(\blacksquare\)

##### Examples
A laptop's lifetime \(L \sim Exp(\theta = 4)\).

a. What is the probability that the laptop will last at least 5 years?
\(P( L \geq 5) = \int_5^\infty \frac{1}{4}e^{-\frac{l}{4}} dl = 1 - P(L < 5) = 1 - (1 - e^{-\frac{5}{4}}) = 0.2865\)

b. If a laptop is 1 year old, what is the chance that the laptop will last for 5 years?

\(P(L \geq 5 | L \geq 1) = \frac{P(L \geq 1 \cap L \geq 5)}{P(L \geq 1)} = \frac{P(L \geq 5)}{P( L\geq 1)} = \frac{0.2865}{1-(1-e^{-\frac{1}{4}})} = 0.3679\)

There is a 36.79% possibility that it will last for 5 years if it already lasted one.
