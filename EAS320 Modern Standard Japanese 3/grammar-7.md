# まずは確認

## 移動
行く is used when an action occurs that moves the subject **away from the speaker**. 来る is used when an action occurs that brings the subject closer to the speaker

> *example*
> 授業が終わったら、何か食べに**行かない**？
> After class, do you want to go somewhere to eat?
> (The action of going *away from the speaker*)

> *example*
> 国からたくさん食べ物が届いたんだけど、これからうちに**来ない**？
> I got a lot of food from my home country, do you want to come over for a bit? (Asking the subject to come closer to the speaker)
> いいの？じゃ、もうちろん行くよ～
> You sure? Of course I'll come. (Speaker comes closer to the subject, thus he is going away from his current position)

## 動作が向かう方向

When an action takes the subject away from his current position, or rather an action has a direction away from the speaker, ～ていく is used. In particular, to indicate an action that takes place that after another action (which brings the speaker away from his current location)

> *example*
> 田中さんの誕生日パーティーにプレゼントを買っていきましょう
> Let's **buy a present (for Tanaka)**, and go to Tanaka's party  


When an action takes the subject towards the speaker's current position, or rather an action has a direction of towards the speaker, ～てくる is used. In particular, to indicate an action that takes place that, after another action, brings the subject closer to the speaker.

> *example*
> 川上から葉っぱが流れてきた。そして、川下へ流れていった。
> Leaves come from upstream. Then, they go downstream.
> (From the point of view from the speaker.)

When something comes towards **you**, like a call or delivery, ～てくる is often used.

> 〇〇さんが（私に）電話をかけてきた・花を送ってきた

## 変化

～ていく、～ てくる are also used to express temporal change. 

To express a change of state that occurs from the past to the present point, or the time in which the topic occurs, ～てくる is used. For example, 増えてくる (it has increased (non-perfective)). Often, it can be combined with いる to indicate that the state of changing is contintiative. For example 増えてきている indicates that it has incresed to the present point, and is still increasing. More specifically, the action continues to move closer to the topic time.

For ～てくる, often the change is perfective. In such a case, it is said that the speker becomes aware of the change, and as such ～てきた is often used. For example, 増えてきた (it has increased (and will not continue to increase))

To express a change of state that starts from the present point and continues to the future, ～ていく is used. 死んでいく (it is dying, that is to say, it will continue to die in the future, and is incomplete.) More generally, the action continues as it moves away from the topic time.

Qualifiers such as 段々、少しずつ、徐々に are often used in such cases.

～てきた is also used to indicate realization of some sensory action. For example, 見えてくる (you will be able to see soon), 降ってきた (realization that it has rained). Compare with classical けり (in fact けり and くる have the same root of 来る).
