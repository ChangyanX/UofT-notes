> (The action of going *away from the speaker*)

> *example*
> 国からたくさん食べ物が届いたんだけど、これからうちに**来ない**？
> I got a lot of food from my home country, do you want to come over for a bit? (Asking the subject to come closer to the speaker)
> いいの？じゃ、もうちろん行くよ～
> You sure? Of course I'll come. (Speaker comes closer to the subject, thus he is going away from his current position)
