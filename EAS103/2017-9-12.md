## Where and When is Premodern East Asia?
* What is "modern"?
* Illusion of an endpoint or *telos*
* Looking at premodern east asia through a lens or modernity distorts the motivations of the premodern history.
* **east** is relative to Europe.

*Myth of Continents* attempted to define the "east" and the "west". The "western world" can not be clearly defined

* Many ways of mapping the world
* Friendly areas would be represented more prominantely
* competing world views depending on where you are
* maps focused on china (central kingdom) similar to europe centered on the holy land
* Everything could potentially share from the "civilized" center.
* Borders foreign to the "premodern" mindset.
* Shouldn't be measuring past societies based on the values of the present society
* Oral culture comparable to digital culture
