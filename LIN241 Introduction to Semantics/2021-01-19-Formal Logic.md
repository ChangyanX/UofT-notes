# 2021-01-19 Formal Logic

* Logic allows us to think about relations between sentences
* Entailment is the 'basis' of language, being able to make formal implications to derive conclusions
* How natlangs differ from artificial languages of logic
* How do we know "le chat est enchant dormier" means the same as "the cat is sleeping"?
* Logic is the study of **valid arguments**
  * sequence of premises with conclusion
* Modus Ponens
  * Affirming the antecedent
  * If it is snows, it is cold. It snows, therefore it is cold.
* Modus Tollens
  * Denying the consequent
  * If John is in love, he is happy. He is not happy, therefore John is not in love. 
* Invalid arguments
  * Denying the antecedent
    * If it snows, it is cold does not imply that if it does not snow, it is not cold.
    * Contrast with contrapositive, If it is not cold, it does not snow.
* Showing that an argument is valid
    * Show every way to make its premises true also make conclusion true
* Showing argument is not valid
  * Show that there is a way to make its conclusion false when all premises are true.
* logically valid argument are valid in virtue of their form
  * validity preserved by substitution of not keywords
  * formal logic allows us to abstract away everything but the form of the argument
* logic is the study of logical keywords (logical constants)
* propositional logic (PL) is a formal system that deals only with one type of constants, truth-functional operators
* coreresponds to the negation in natlangs, and a number of subordinating and coordinating operations, like and, or, if
* we can learn more about natural language, properties of natlang words
* try to understand whether "becing a logical word" is a property that is relevant to the grammar of natlands
* ask whether languages vary in the way they implement such logical constants
* PL only has two types of expressions
  * symbols that represent atomic propositions
  * logical operators on these propositions
  * a proposition has either a true or false value
  * a proposition is denoted by a formula
  * formulae are atomic when they have no structure
    * Chris is happy and Jess is sad <==> p ^ q
