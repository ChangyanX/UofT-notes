# 2021-01-19 Formal Logic

* Logic allows us to think about relations between sentences
* Entailment is the 'basis' of language, being able to make formal implications to derive conclusions
* How natlangs differ from artificial languages of logic
* How do we know "le chat est enchant dormier" means the same as "the cat is sleeping"?
* Logic is the study of **valid arguments**
  * sequence of premises with conclusion
* Modus Ponens
  * Affirming the antecedent
  * If it is snows, it is cold. It snows, therefore it is cold.
* Modus Tollens
  * Denying the consequent
  * If John is in love, he is happy. He is not happy, therefore John is not in love. 
* Invalid arguments
  * Denying the antecedent
    * If it snows, it is cold does not imply that if it does not snow, it is not cold.
    * Contrast with contrapositive, If it is not cold, it does not snow.
* Showing that an argument is valid
    * Show every way to make its premises true also make conclusion true
* Showing argument is not valid
  * Show that there is a way to make its conclusion false when all premises are true.
