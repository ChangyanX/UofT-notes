## Moment Generating Functions Examples

### Using MGF to find expected value
For an RV \(U \sim Exp(5)\), find the MGF and use it to find \(E(U^4)\).

Notice that \(f(u) = \frac{1}{5} e^{-u/5}\).

Then the MGF \(M(t) = E(e^{tu}) = \int_0^\infty e^{tu} \cdot \frac{1}{5} e^{-u/5} = \frac{1}{5} \int_0^\infty e^{-u(\frac{1}{5} - t})\)

Since any value of \(t\) is a constant with respect to \(u\), (and we are integrating with respect to \(u\)), we can just take the integral as

\(\frac{1}{5}(\frac{-5}{1-5t}) e^{-u(\frac{1}{5} - t)}\), evaluated at 0 and \(\infty\). \(M(t) = (1-5t)^{-t}\).

To find \(E(U^4) = M^{(4)}(0) = 50(15)(20)(1-0)^{-5} = 15000\)

### Using MGF to find probabilities
An RV \(G\) has MGF \(M_G(t) = (0.35 + 0.65e^t)^{10}\). Find \(P(G \geq 3)\).
Notice that the dist of \(G \sim Bin(10, 0.65)\) Since binomial has MGF \(M(t) = (q + pe^t)^n\)

Hence \(P(G \geq 3) = 1 - P(G = 0) - P(G=1) - P(G =2) = ... = 99.52\%\)

## Functions of random variable
A function of a random variable \(g(X)\) may not have the same distribution as \(X\).

Let \(X\) have PDF

\[
f(x) = \begin{cases} 2(1-x) &, 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\ 0 \end{cases}
\]

Let \(Y = 2X-1\). What is \(P(Y < -0.6)\)?

Since \(P(X < x) = F(x)\). Solving \(Y\) for \(x\) \(P(Y < y) = P(2X-1 < y) = P(X < \frac{y+1}{2})\). For a discrete value of \(y\), \(P(2X-1 < -0.6) = P(X < 0.2)\)

Which can be found by integration.

What is \(P(-0.6 \leq Y \leq -0.4)\)? This is the same as \(P(Y \leq 0.4) - P(Y \leq 0.6)\)

## Distribution Method
Let \(Y = g(X)\) where \(X\) has a known distribution. To find the CDF of \(Y\)
 1. Find the corresponding region of \(Y\) using \(X\). (Find the new domain)
 2. Start with finding the culmulative distribution function of \(Y\), and relate it back to \(X\).
  \[F_y(y) = P(Y \leq y) = P(g(X) \leq y) = P(X \leq g^{-1}(y)) = \int_{-\infty}^{g^{-1}(y)} f(x) dx\]
3. The density function of \(Y\) is given by \(F_y'(y)\).

Suppose, from the previous definition of \(X\), that \(U = X^2\). If \(x \in [0, 1]\) then \(u \in [0, 1]\). Note that for example if \(x\) was define between -2 and 4, then \(u \in [0, 16]\), since \(u\) can take values between 0 and 16.

Hence the CDF of \(U\) is given by 

\[\int_0^{\sqrt{u}} 2 - 2x dx\]

After differentiation, \(f_U(u) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{u}}\) for \(u \in [0,1]\), 0 otherwise.

### Example
Let \(X\) have PDF \(f(x) = \frac{2}{x^2}, x > 1\).

Find the PDF of \(Y = \sqrt{X}\). The support of \(y\) is \(y > 1\). Finding an inverse for \(Y\), we have the CDF of \(Y\) \(F_Y(y) = \int_1^{y^2} \frac{2}{x^2} dx\). After differentiation we have \(f_Y(y) = \frac{4}{y^3}\) for \(y > 1\) (0 otherwise)


## Transformation Methods
If \(Y = g(X)\) where \(X\) is an RV with known distribution, then 
1. Write the PDF of \(X\)
2. Find the inverse \(X = g^{-1}(Y)\). If the inverse is continuous and one to one for all \(Y\) in the range of \(g(x)\), or mathematically \(Y \in \{g(x) : x \in X\}\)
3. If the derivative of \(g^{-1}\) exists with respect to \(y\), then  \(f_Y(y) = f_X(g^{-1}(y))|g^{-1'}(y)|\) 

## MGF Uniquemenss

If the MGF of an RV has form \(e^{\mu t + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2t^2}\) it can be characterized as a normal distribution.

MGF of a gamma distribution is \((1 - \beta t) ^ {-\alpha}\)
