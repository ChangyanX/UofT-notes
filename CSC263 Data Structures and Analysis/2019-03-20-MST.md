# MST

We want to find *some* MST of a graph \(G\). Remember the MST construction theorem. 

## Kruskal's algorithm

```


The first step is to sort all the edges by edge weights

|Edge|Weight|
|-|-|
|AB|1|
|CD|1|
|BD|2|
|BC|2|
|ED|4|
|EA|5|
|EC|6|
|EB|7|

We start with an empty spanning forest

\[\{A\}, \{B\} , \{C\} ,\{D\}, \{E\}\]

The first edge is \(AB\). We add \(AB\)

\[\{A,B\} , \{C\} ,\{D\}, \{E\}\]

The next edge to add is CD

\[\{A, B\} , \{C, D\}, \{E\}\]

The next edge is BD.

\[\{A, B, C, D\}, \{E\}\]

and finally ED

\[\{A, B, C, D, E\}\]


And this is a minimal spanning tree. Notice that this is a set of operations on a disjoint set. If they have the same representative, then they share an edge. Otherwise, do a union, and they will merge 2 trees into a single tree.


So, if \(V = \{1, 2, ..., n\}\) is the set of nodes, and E is the array of weighted edges (we will build a min-heap of the edges as a small optimization).

1. `BuildMinHeap(E)`
2. Forest = \(\{1\}, \{2\}, ... \{3\}\) (\(n\) calls to MAKESET)
3. MST_Edges = []
4. While |MST_Edges| < n-1
   1. u, v <- ExtractMin(E)
   2. T_u = Find(u)
   3. T_v = Find(v)
   4. if (T_u != T_v) 
      1. Union (T_u, T_v)
      2. MST_Edges.append((u, v))

What is the cost?

ExtractMin costs \(m \log m\) in total. We do 2 finds for each finds, hence at most we do at most \(2m\) finds. Then we do \(n-1\) unions. We have then that \(m \log m\), where since \(m < n^2\), \(m \log n\).

## Prim's Algorithm
We start with some node. Then we select an edge the smallest edge.
