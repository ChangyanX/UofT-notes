# Loads and Stores

**Loads** are read operations: We read from memory and write it into the register.
**Stores** are from registers into memory. Store instructions do not have a destination register.

Consider the instruction `lw $t0, 12($s0)` . `$t0` is the the register that the value will be stored in to. `$s0` is the memory address to read from, and the constant is the memory offset from `$s0`. This is an I-type instruction.

All instructions follow this regex: `(l|s)(w|h|b)u?` where `(l|s)` denote load or store, then byte, half-word, and word, and whether or not the value is unsigned. If its unsigned, the memory value will be zero extended, otherwise it is byte-extended.

`lw` loads the entire word, so no sign extension occurs. `s` instructions do not take unsigned either, and write the lower significant byte/halfwords.

Note that misaligned memory accesses results in errors. Word accesses has to be word-aligned (divisible by four), and half-words must be halfword-aligned.
