# Graphs

Recall the definition of a graph 

\(G = (V, E)\). Where \(|V| = n\), and \(|E| = m\). For directed graphs, each edge is an **ordered pair**. That is, \((u, v) \neq (v, u)\). For undirected graphs, each edge is unordered. That is, \((u, v) = (v, u)\).

## Examples

### Undirected

\(V = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\), \(E = \{(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (2, 5), ...\}\)

```
1 -- 2 
|   / \
|  /    3
| /    /
5 -- 4 
```
### Directed
\(V = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\), \(E = \{(1, 2), (1, 4), (4, 2), (2, 5), ...\}\)


```
1 --> 2 
|   ^ |    3
|  /  |  / |
v /   v v  v
4 --> 5    6 <->
```

Where `<->` is a loopback.

## Representations

We can not just store arrays of tuples, since we have to scan through the entire array to check for neighbours.

### Adjacency lists
Array \(Adj[1, ..., n]\) of \(n = |V|\) lists. Each list at \(i\) contains the list of nodes that are adjacent to the node at \(i\). That is, for each vertex \(u\), \(Adj[u]\) contains a list of list of all the nodes adjacent to \(u\).



```
Adjacency list of the above unordered graph

1 |---> 2 -> 5
2 |---> 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3
3 |---> 2 -> 4
4 |---> 5 -> 2 -> 3
5 |---> 1 -> 2 -> 4
  
```

```
Adjacency list of the above ordered graph

1 |---> 2 -> 4
2 |---> 5 -> 1
3 |---> 5 -> 6
4 |---> 2 -> 5
5 |---> 
6 |---> 6
  
```

This takes \(n +m\) space.

### Adjacency matrix.

An \(n \times n\) matrix \(A\), where \(A[i, j]\) is 1 if \((i, j)\in E\), an 0 otherwise.


```
Adjacency matrix of the above undirected graph

  |1|2|3|4|5|
--+-+-+-+-+-+
1 |0 1 0 0 1|
2 |1 0 1 1 1|
3 |0 1 0 1 0|
4 |0 1 1 0 1|
5 |1 1 0 1 0|
```


```
  |1|2|3|4|5|6|
--+-+-+-+-+-+-+
1 |0 1 0 1 0 0|
2 |0 0 0 0 1 0|
3 |0 0 0 0 1 1|
4 |0 0 0 0 0 0|
5 |0 0 0 0 0 1|
```


This takes \(n^2\) space.


## Graph Search

* Follow edges of the nodes to find new nodes
* Reveals some structural properties of graphs

## Breadth First Search (BFS)

\(BFS(G, S)\) , where \(G\) is a graph and \(S\) the source vertex (where you start searching).

1. Explore vertices (follow all edges of \(S\) to discover new nodes).
2. Explore the discovered nodes in the order of discovery
3. Continue until all discovered nodes are explored.

We can simply use a queue to implement this algorithm.
Keep the following info.

\(Color(V) = \text{White} | \text{Grey} | \text{Black}\), where `White` is undiscovered, `Grey` is discovered but not fully explored, and `Black` is fully explored.

\(Parent(V) = U\), when you discover \(V\) while exploring \(U\).

\(d(V)\) where \(V\) is the length of the discovery path to \(V\) from \(S\)


### Pseudocode
Let \(G = (V, E)\), and \(s \in V\). Let \(Q\) be the set of grey vertices.
```typescript
type Color = White | Grey | Black
type Vertex = { Color: Color, Distance: Int, Parent: Vertex}
type Edge = (Vertex, Vertex) 
type Graph = (Vertex[], Edge[])


const Init = (v: Vertex[]) => {
    for (_v of v) {
        v.Color = White
        v.Distance = Inf
        v.Parent = Null
    }
} 

const Search = (g: Graph) => {
    let Queue: Queue<Vertex | Color = Grey>
    while (!Queue.Empty) {
        let u = Queue.deque()
        for (const {v, _} of g.Edges.Where({u, v} == u)) {
            if (v.Color == White) {
                v.Color = Grey
                v.Parent = u
                v.Distance = u.Distance + 1
                Queue.enque(v)
            }
        }
        u.Color = black
    }
}
```
