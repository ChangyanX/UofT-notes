## Priority Queues

### Object
> Set `S` of elements with keys that can be compared/

### Operations:
* `Insert(S, x)` Inserts element `x` in `S`
* `Max(S)` Gets the maximum element of `S`
* `ExtractMax(S)` Gets the maximum element of `S`, and removes it from the queue.

```rust
trait <T> PriorityQueue<T> {
    fn insert(mut Self, x: T);
    fn max(Self) -> &T;
    fn extract_max(mut Self) -> T; 
}
```
## Implementations

|Structure|Insert|Extract_Max|
|--|--|--|
|Unordered Linked List|\(\Theta(1)\)|\(\Theta(n)\)
|Ordered Linked List|\(\Theta(n)\)|\(\Theta(1)\)|

Can we do both operations in \(\Theta(\log)\)?

### Complete Binary Tree

> *def'n* Complete Binary Tree
> * A binary tree at all levels \(n\) except perhaps the bottom level has \(2^n\) nodes. 
> * All notes in the bottom level are as far to the left as possible.

A height of a CBT with \(n\) nodes is exactly \(\lfloor \log_2 n \rfloor\). (Can we prove this from definition?)

### Max-Heap
The Max-Heap Property is that the **priority** of each node is \(\geq\) priority of its children. Thus, a **Max-Heap** is a CBT with this property for all its nodes.

```yaml
17: 
  9: 
   7: [ 3, 4 ]
   7
  12: [ 9, 5 ]
```

**Index starts at 1 in this course (草生えるwww)**

This tree can be represented as follows in an array

```
A | 17 | 9 | 12 | 7 | 7 | 9 | 5 | 3 | 4
---------------------------------------
i | 1  | 2 | 3  | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
```

The left child is at `A[2*i]`, and the right at `A[2*i + 1]`, where `i` is the index of the 

If we are at a child `i` parent of `A[i]` is `A[i//2]`


```rust
impl <T> PriorityQueue<T> for MaxHeap<T>   {
    /// ! To insert an element, 
    fn insert(mut self, x: T) {
        // 1. Increase the heap size, and insert the element at A of heapsize 
        let size = self.extend(1, x);

        // 2. Percolate up the tree while priority of x > priority of parent, swap x with parent.
        while self.priority(x) > self.priority(self.parent(size - 1)) {
            self.swap(x, self.parent(x))
        }
    }

    fn max(self) -> &T {
        &self[0]
    }

    fn extract_max(mut self) -> mut T {
        // Pop the first element
        let carry = mut self[0];
        self[0] = self.last();
        // Drip the element in A[0] down the tree.
        while x <= self.size() / 2 && priority(x.children()) > priority(x) {
            swap(x)...
        }
        carry
    }
}
```

## What is the worst case complexity of `Insert(A, x)` and `ExtractMax(A, x)`?
\(O(\log n)\), and \(\Omega(\log n\)\), since the number of swaps will be at most \(\log n\). 

## HeapSort

To sort an array \(A\) of \(n\) elements...
  * Make a heap out of the elements of \(A\)
    * Each insert takes \(\log n\) naively but can be done in \(\Theta(n)\) time.
    * ExtractMax \(n\) times takes \(\Theta \log n\) time but can also be done in place for \(\Theta n\)
    * Worse-case is \(\Theta n \log n\).
