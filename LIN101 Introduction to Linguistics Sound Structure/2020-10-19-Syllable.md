* Evidence of syllables
* Parts of syllables
* Role of sonority in syllables
* Truncation
  * Indonesian
    * anak - nak
    * bapak - pak
    * Agus - Gus
    * Lilik - Lik
    * !! CVC template
* Epenthesis
  * English words when borroe into Bouma Fijian
    * kaloko - clock
    * aapolo 
    * tSone
* Syllable is an abstract phonological unit
  * All languages have syllables
  * All words have syllables
  * Consists of consonants and vowels arranged in onset, nucleus, coda 
    * nucleus and coda form a rime
  * Phonological evidence
* Experimental Evidence
  * *Pal*ace vs *Pa*lmier (french)
  * PA perceived faster than PAL in Palace
  * PAL perceived faster than PAL in Palmier
* Text setting
  * rhymes, number of syllables in a line
* Consituents
  * [\(\sigma\) [Onsset] [Rime [Nucleus] [Coda]]]
  * Some are more obligiatory
  * **Nucleus is required**
    * Entire syllable can be a nucleus
  * Onsets are desired
    * All languages prefer onsets
    * Some languages required onsets
    * No languages avoid onsets
  * Codas are avoided
    * All languages avoid codas
    * Some languages do not allow codas
    * No languages require codas
  * Every vowel can be a nucleus, some consonants are nuclei
* asymmetries
  * CV is generally preferred, VC is generally avoided
    * VCV can be syllabified **V.CV** or VC.V, but VC.V is never attested.
  * Nuclei only syllables **are less common than onsets**
  * Not all languages allow syllabic consonants
* Onsets allowed != Onsets not required
  * Onsets are **always allowed** (no languages avoid onsets)
  * Codas are **never required**
  * However they may not be required, as compared to other languages where an onset **must always be present**
* Possible syllables: V, CV, VC, CVC
* Codas are often restricted
  * In German, voiced obstruents {v z} are not possible, but voiceless {f s} are
  * In Japanese only /ん/ and /っ/ are allowed as codas
    * Codas must agree with place of articulation with following onset
* Simple vs compklex codas
  * |                        | Simple codas only   | Complex codas allowed            |
    | ---------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
    | Simple onsets only     | CV, CVC             | CV, CVC, CVCC                    |
    | Complex onsets allowed | CV, CVC, CCV, CCCVC | CV, CVC, CVCC, CCV, CCVC, CCVVCC |
* We will treat diphthong vowels as simple vowels (as hey are one segment)
  
* Evidence for syllables come from loanwords
  * Complex structure to simple structure loanwords
  * Try to preserve sound as much as possible
  * target languages imposes restrictions, often to do with syllable structure
  * epethensis (to insert)
    * vowel insertion for languages that disallow complex onsets
* Sonority
  * Consider 'amarta'. In all languages, this can only be syllabified [a.mar.ta]
  * Why do we see print but no onsets like `*rpint` or `*lseep`?
  * Sonority Hierarchy
    * Some segments prefer to be close to the edge, some closer to the nucleus
    * Most to least sonorous
      * Vowels
      * Glides ([j w])
      * Liquids ([l r])
      * Nasals ([n m])
      * Obstruents (stops, fricatives, affricates)
    * The closer you are to the nucleus, the more sonorous the segment
    * `rpint` can not work because sonority must rise or be even towards a nucleus, and not the other way around.
