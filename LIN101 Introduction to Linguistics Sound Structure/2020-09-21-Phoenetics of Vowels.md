# 2020-09-21 Phonetics of Vowels

* All languages have a limited number of vowels
* Articulatory phonetics: how the speech organ is used to produce sounds
* Phonetics is concerned with speech sounds
  * how they are articulated, what their properties are
  * speech is an interaction between a speaker and a listener
* Speaker:
  * Speaker's brain comes up with a statement
  * leading to muscles in mouth and speech organs to produce speech
* Listener
  * Sound waves from speech goes to ear
  * Decoded in the brain 
* Focus on how sounds are produced
* Phonetics
  * A branch of linguistics concerned with sound of human speech (or signs)
  * physical properties of speech sounds
    * articulation
    * acoustic properties
    * perception
    * neurophysiological properties
* Three branches
  * articulatory
  * acoustic
  * auditory phonetics/perceived
    * mcgurc effect: visual information clashes with auditory information
* Sound is vibrations that travel through a medium
  * expansions and contraction
  * sound waves propagate at 340 m/s at room temp
  * ~3 seconds per kilometre
* Frequency of sound is 20-20kHz at normal conditions
  * Upper range decrease at age
  * below 20Hz: Infrasound
  * above 20kHz: Ultrasound
  * animals can hear above and below the range
* Speech organs
  * how sound is produced
  * **Diaphragm**
    * Pressed up to facilitate airflow from the lungs
  * **Trachea**
    * Air goes up trachea to the mouth and nasal cavity
  * Goes from the Pharynx then oral and nasal cavity
* **Egressive airstream mechanism**
  * Sound when air moves out the lungs
  * Intercostal: between the ribs
  * Diaphraghm: separates chest from abdomen
  * Air goes up from lungs to trachea
* Air then moves through the Larynx: voice box
  * adam's apple: thyroid cartilage
* vocal folds vibrate to produce sound when you speaker
* Thyroid, arytenoid, cricoid cartileges
  * Thyroid articulates with cricoid
  * Arytenoid cartilage sit on the posterior cricoid
* Vocal folds are muscle that that can be relaxed, vibrating or closed
  * Vibration caused by Bernoulli effect. 
  * Subglotta pressure (below the vocal volds) must be sufficient to sustain vocal fold vibration
  * vocal folds close and open from the bottom to the top
* Most important speech organs are in oral cavity
* Speech organs modify the airstream
  * Vocal Folds
  * Tongue
  * Lips
  * Back of mouth
* Entrance to naval cavity can be controlled by soft palette
* Uvula can move and create sound
* Soft palate
* Alveolar ridge
  * produces consonants
* Lips round to make different vowels
* Tongue
  * Tip
  * Body
  * Root
  * crucial articulator in most sounds
  * move horizontally (front-back) or vertically (up-down)
  * tip is very flexible
* Lips
  * Rounded during articulation of some sounds
* Speech sounds (phones)
  * allow for a diverse set of speech sounds (phones)
  * many articulators may be active at the same time (co-ocurring)
  * many events follow in a fast pace (sequential)
  * tongue can change very rapidly
  * vowels or consonants
    * vowels have no obstruction in oral cavity
    * consonants have some obstruction in oral cavity
* **vowels**
  * articulators
    * vocal folds (vibrating)
    * tongue (not touching roof, lower/higher, front/back)
    * lips: open, rounded/unrounded
    * smooth airflow
  * three criteria
    * tongue backness (front, central, back)
    * tongue height (high, mid, low)
    * lip rounding (round, unrounded)
* **transcription**
  * segment is a way to represent speech sounds
  * segments involve many articulatory events that may not be synchronous
  * english orthography is not very informative
  * ideally we want a 1-1 correspondence between segments and symbols
  * not all languages have writing system that correspond to sounds
  * **IPA** based on Latin alphabet
    * 107 letters + 52 diacritics
    * can transcribe any spoken language
  * Sounds classified based on phonetic content

  * The important vowels in English are [i] (ea, beat), [ɪ] (i, bit), [ʊ] (oo, book), [u] (oo, boo), [ə] (a, about [schwa]), [ɛ] (e, beg [epsilon]), [ʌ] (u, buck [caret]), [æ] (a, back), and [ɑ] (o, bog)

  * In English, [ʌ] is considered mid-central. Only [ʊ] and [u] are rounded in English.

  * Front vowels are often unrounded
  * back vowels typically rounded
  * some vowels are stable (monophthongs), some are considered transisions (diphthongs) 

* Canadian english diphthongs
  * [eɪ] (a, fate) 
  * [aɪ] (ie, lies)
  * [oɪ] (oy, boy)
  * [aʊ] (ow, crowd)
  * [oʊ] (o, note)
* All have a non high vowel in the first part, then a high vowel in the end.

  * ɯ turned m
