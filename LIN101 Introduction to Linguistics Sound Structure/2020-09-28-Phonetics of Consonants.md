* All world languages have a finite number of sounds
* Language inventories are more similar than by chance
  * some consonants are extremely common some are are
* inventories are systematic
  * every consonant can be characterized by a limited number of parameters
* in consonants, the important speech organs are
  * alveolar ridge
  * hard palate
  * soft palate (velum)
  * uvula
  * nasal cavity
  * teeth
* nasal cavity closed off in rest position
  * closed off by uvula and soft palate
* in /t/ and /n/ notice your tongue touches alveolar ridge
  * airflow is blocked
  * /n/ is voiced however
    * soft palate is lower in /n/
  * /t/ is voiceless
* all languages have sounds made in the alveolar ridge
  * except hawaiian (?)
* in /sh/ there is some narrowing but is not closed off
  * turbulent airflow near the alveolar ridge
* unlike vowels, consonant have constricted airflow
  * can be full are partial
  * can be at various places, lips, soft palate, vocal folds
* articulators
| articulator    | setting                                             | name                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| vocal folds    | vibrating or spread apart                           | glottal                |
| tongue         | many configurations                                 | retroflex              |
| lips           | closed, open, rounded, narrow, touching upper teeth | bilabial, labialdental |
| uvula          | vibrating, relaxed                                  | uvular                 |
| soft palate    | raised or lowered                                   | velar                  |
| hard palate    | N/A                                                 | palatal                |
| teeth          | N/A                                                 | dental                 |
| alveolar ridge | tongue partial or full constriction                 | alveolar, postalveolar |
* soft palate actually blocks off nasal cavity
  * can be lowered to pass through nose to produce nasal sounds
* nasal stops
  * /n/, /m/, /ng/ (as in bank)
  * there is nasal airflow
  * larynx: voiced (vibrating)
  * oral cavity: complete obstruction by tongue or lips
  * nasal cavity: soft palate lowered
* fricatives
  * /s/ (sit), /z/ (zone), /sh/, /th/, /h/ (hit, ahead) 
  * like stops, except obstruction is not complete
  * narrowing at some place of articulation turbulent airflow
  * can be lengthened to check voicing
  * larynx: voiced or voiceless
  * oral cavity: **partial obstruction**, turbulent airflow
  * nasal cavity: soft palate raised
  * contrast /n/ and /z/
* glottis: opening between vocal folds
* multiple articulators involved
* most consonants have single point of constriction, some have multiple
* for vowels, 3 configurations
  * tongue height
  * tongue fronting
  * lips roundedness
* consonants
  * place of articulation (constriction)
  * manner of articulation (type of constriction)
  * laryngeal configuration (voiced or voiceless)
* english only has /j/ palatal 
* retroflex: partial obstruction
* palatal: full obstruction
* uvular: partial obstruction
* manner of articulation: full or partial constuction
  * /d/ is a oral stop (full constriction)
  * /z/ is a narrowing (fricative turbulent airflow)
  * /n/ is a nasal stop (full constriction)
  * fricative
  * affricate
    * /ch/ or /dÊ’/ (**j**azz)
    * similar to stops and fricatives
    * complete obstruction in oral cavity, then slow release creating turbulent airflow
    * slow released stop
    * quite common
  * flap/tap
    * /t/, /d/
    * r-like sounds characterized by fast movement of articulators
  * trill
    * bu**rr**ito
    * flaps and taps except multiple movements
    * different articulators can be involved (lips, tongue, tip, uvula)
  * approximant
    * vowel like, but not vowel
    * yet, wet (/j/, /w/)
    * slight constriction but larger than in vowel
  * lateral approximant
    * /l/ (like, let, aloud, ball)
    * divided airflow
* only stops, fricatives, and affricates can distinguish voicing
  * other sounds (nasals, taps, trills, laterals, approximants) are **usually** voiced
* dental fricatives are crosslinguistically rare
  * th (think) /d (though)
* english r (alveolar approximant) is quite rare
* haven't discussed stress and pitch
* only considered sounds formed with air exiting lungs
* pulmonic consonants: exiting lungs
* non-pulmonics:
  * clicks
    * closure in mouth, expanded by muscles causing negative pressure
  * ejectives
    * upward movement of the glottis causing positive pressure
    * voiceless 
  * implosives
    * downward movement of glottis creates negative pressure
    * typically voiced
* acoustic phonetics
  * acoustic properties of speech
  * can be represented in many ways
  * duration, f-zero, spectrals
* speech perception
  * how we perceive speech
  * complex, may involve visual cues
  * some distinctions are easier to perceive that other
* mcgurk effect
  * visual illusion in mouth movements
  * mouth movement influences sound perception
* big picture
  * gain insight into how humans produce speech
  * similarities across languages are systematic
  * know the most common sounds => easier to learn another language
