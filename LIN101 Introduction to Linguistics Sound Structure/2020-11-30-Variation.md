* variation in language
  * core properties of human language
  * variation within a language or even for a single speaker
  * is variation really ever free
    * never completely optional to be one thing or another
    * social factor, sociolinguistic parameter
* sociolinguistics
  * how social factors identify the way ppl use language
  * language always developers with societal factors
    * gender, education, ethnicity, class, age
  * language contact, borrowing
  * language birth and death
  * *geographical variation*
  * *variation and social factors*
  * *language change*
  * **Variation in language carries social meaning!!**
  * able to tell things about a person by the way they speak
  * within a speech community, different people speak differently
  * people use social meaning of variation to make judgement about other speakers or shape judgment
    * someone can pretend to be someone else by shifting the way they speak
  * varieties have prestige
    * standard ("correct")
    * stigmatized (low class, uneducated, "improper")
  * prestige dialect is stereotypically associated with social status
  * social evaluation of variation is arbitrary
  * what determines standard?
    * spoken by social elite
    * nothing inherently "better" or "worse
* lexical variation
  * pop ~ soda
  * bathroom ~ washroom
* morphological or syntactic
  * gonna ~ will
  * done (with) my homework (canadianism)
* phonogical
  * waking ~ walkin'
  * rhoticism (park your car)
  * uptalk
* var word
  * variable -- how do you call this
  * variant -- domain of the variables i.e.
    * soda/pop: [soda, pop, coke, soft drink]
    * 2pl: [you guys, you, y'all, you all]
    * weekend summer house: [cabin, camp, chalet, cottage, bungalow]
* cot-caught merger
* dialects
  * variety of language characteristic to a group of a language's speakers
  * dialects of a single language are typically mutually intelligible
    * this is complicated
    * arabic is typically considered a single language, but it is not mutually intelligle
    * danish/swedish/norweigian are *mostly* mutually intelligible, but are different languages
  * accent ~ similar to dialect, refers to phonetic and phonological characteristics
  * regional dialect is a variety of language that is characteristic of an area
    * often will differ in more than one variable
    * lines that divide a variants are called 'isoglosses' and typically are grouped nearby in *bundles*
      * results in dialectal areas with a transition zone
  * idiolect one individual's speech
  * group of idiolects are a dialect
  * dialectology
    * subfield of sociolinguistics that study variation in space
    * also studies how different regional dialects are related historically
* within a community
  * socioeconomic class
  * gender
  * age
  * ethnicity
  * profession
  * education
* variable (ing)
  * all dialects in english show variation between [IN] and [In] but optional to some degree
    * ask which, but also how often people choose 
    * which is standard? [IN] is standard 
    * [In] is more common in verbs, but [IN] more common in nouns
    * [In] common in fast speech, also associated with lower socioeconomic class
    * three styles, casual careful and reading
* how is data obtained
  * collect lots of data from speech community
  * in this case find all instances of (ing)
  * specify properties of speech, and speaker 
  * collect different kinds of data
    * speech, written (texts), often not marked in orthography
    * hardest kind is when speakers are not paynig too much attention
      * casual, informal with little linguistic self-conscience
    * sociolinguistic interview
      * interviewer sits down with person from community and asks questions
      * observers paradox: speaker will be more careful with how they speak
        * some strategies:
          * attach a microphone for days until speaker forgets its there
          * distract people with a task they have to work on and talk through
          * have friends interview each other
          * ask open ended questions that prompt long stories
            * emotional stories
      * women tend to be more linguistically standard in the western world (why?)
        * socialization: some sociolinguistics speculate that women are more likely to be evaluated for their language and punished for sounding non-standard
        * women also tend to lend linguistic change in the west
          * women will almost always be farther ahead in adopting a new form than men of the same age/background
            * regardless of whether change is towards a standard form or a new/non-standard form
* stability
  * (ing) is a stable variable
    * frequency of two variants has not changed much
  * interest in ongoing change
    * look at speakers of different ages
    * younger speakers will use newer variants than older speakers
    * adolescents more likely to use new variants than children
    * women more likely to lead this change
    * older speakers will be dead and younger speakers will age
  * language change can be from above (prestigious to non-prestigious) or from below (low prestige to standard)
    * department store study: rhoticism in NYC is variable, deletion depends on socioeconomic class
    * in 1960s, non-rhoticism was changing from standard to non-standard
    * rapid and anonymous survey: pick some item located on fourth floor and ask employees where to find it, and mark rhoticism
  * change from below 
    * starts in working class or lower middle class
      * usually but not always led by women
    * starts below level of consciousness: people don't notice change
      * when people start to notice new variant often stigmatized
    * *be like* probably originated a change from below
* covert prestige
  * non-standardness associated with desirable features
    * casualness, friendliness, solidarity with low prestige social groups
* document change in progress
  * **apparent-time change**
    * document data from multiple age groups at **one point in time**
    * change in progress, and change is apparent
  * **real time change**
    * collect data twice at different times
    * we can combine data from both data sets, normalize by age
* variation never random, affected by social factors
* sociolinguistics studies effect of social factors on language including variation and change
* language change arises because of different levels of prestige associated with variants
* variants are more prestigiuous because it is associated with a social group that has more power in a speech community
