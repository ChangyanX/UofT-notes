# 2020-10-05 Phonology

* What is phonology
  * Phonetic transcript can be more or less precise
  * Can be alveolar flap, glottal stop, or a dental stops
  * intuitively these sounds are all 't'
  * teen, bin, hen, all have nasal vowels!
* Phonology: phone (voice) + logos (word, discussion)
  * branch of cognitive science on how the human minds store sound and sound patterns
  * not about articularly properties, about stress, syllabus
  * distributions within and across languages
  * syllable structures
  * alternates in different contexts
* final devoicing
  * many languages, word final stops are voiceless
  * bat, tis, sop, lef (O)
  * bad, tiz, sob, lev (X)
  * in general, voiced stops and fricatives are not desirable at the end of the word
* voiced [z] is longer than voiceless [s] (phonetic distinction)
* why is final devoicing so common?
  * voicing is difficult to maintain at the end of the worl
  * voicing is difficult to perceive when no vowel follows
* contrast
  * sounds contrast word meanings
  * inventory = finite number of contrastive sounds
  * in english, [t] and [d] are constrastive, eg. [t]ire, [d]ire
  * not all distinctions are constrastive
  * sounds can vary depending on the environment
  * sometimes a certain sound is possible in some environments, but not others.
* minimal pair: two words that differ in only a single sound
  * tire, and tired are not minimal pairs
* in english, l sounds vary from one context
  * file, fool, all have velarized l
  * listen, lose, allow, aglow are plain [l]
  * at the end of words, velerized l occurs, with l elsewhere.
  * they are pronounced differently but "seem" to be the same sound
    * you can't create new words by changing the two ls, but you can with t and d. t-d are contrastive in english.
* A phoneme is **the smallest segmental unit** that distinguishes meaning
  * In english /t/ /d/ are distinct
  * language have finite number of phonemes
  * inventories vary in size
  * not all segments are equally frequent
    * [i], schwa, are quite common
    * turned r is quite rare
* How do we know whether two sounds are two different phonemes?
  * They appear in the same environment
  * Minimal pair test
* Allophones
  * Some distinctions between sounds are not contrastive
  * Each phoneme can have several realizations, called allophones
  * eg. english l-sounds vary depending on context
  * eg. english t-sounds vary depending on context
    * aspirated t appears t the beginning of stressed syllables, and dental t appears elsewhere
    * both [t] and [t^h] never appear in the same environment
  * they are related
    * phonetically similar
    * complementary distribution
  * phonetically distinct, but the same phoneme
  * 'elsewhere' allophone is the name of the phoneme by convention
* phonetic transcription can be misleading
  * often levels of detail
  * contrastive sounds (always)
  * non-contrastive properties (sometimes)
* structuralism
  * idea: sound patterns of a language form a system
  * starts in the beginning of 20th century
  * in 19th century was mostly historical
* Two levels of representation
  * abstract level: /phonemes/
  * concrete level: [allophones]
* If two sounds in complementary distribution that are not phonetically similar, they are not allophones of the same phoneme
* Free variation: two sounds that can be freely used in the same environment without changing meaning
* in english, stops can be released or unreleased in word final
  * weep 
  * look
* allophones in free variation
  * does not change meaning of the word
* need to distinguish 2 different levels of abstraction
* always indirect abstract analysis
* allophonic rules
  * A -> B / C __ D
  * "A becomes B when preceded by C and followed by D"
  * CAD -> CBD
  * A, B, C, D can be...
    * Segments
    * V for vowels, C for consonants,
    * C and D can be nothing
    * word boundaries #     
  * A is the elsewhere allophone
* How do we rewrite the velarized l rule?
  * l -> É« / __ #
  * we want to make the rule as general as possible
* Optionality
  * segments may be realized variantly
