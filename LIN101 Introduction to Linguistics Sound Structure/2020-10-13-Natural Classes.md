# 2020-10-13 Natural Classes

* Sound patterns are not random
  * systematic
  * sensitive to phonological props of sound
  * many sounds behave similarly to language
* allophones of the same phoneme must be phonetically similar
  * similar sounds tend to pattern together
  * what does it mean to be similar
    * member of the same natural class
    * two sounds are more similar the more phonetic properties they share
* consider [t], [d], [z]
  * [t], [d] are stops
  * [d], [z] are voiced
  * [t], [z] are not related
  * [t], [d], [z] are all coronal consonants
  * 6 non-empty natural classes:
    * [t], [d], [z]: obstruents
    * [t], [d]: stops
    * [d], [z]: voiced
    * [t]: voiceless stop
    * [d]: voiced stop
    * [z]: voiced fricative
* phonetically similar sounds share a *natural class*
  * based on articulatory and phonetic propertis
  * major
    * **vowels [i e a o u]**
      * no obstruction
    * **consonants [m t k r l s z d j w]**
      * some obstruction
    * **sonorants [a o m n r l w j]**
      * non-turbulent airflow 
      * vowels, nasals, trills, taps, approximants
    * **obstruents [p t d b f v x ts tʃ]**
      * turbulent airflow
      * stops, fricatives, affricates
    * vowels and consonants show different patterns
      * some languages do not mark vowels
      * many languages require all words to begin with C, or end in V
      * many languages allow words to consist only of V
        * no language allows words to consist only of C
    * sonorants vs obstruents
      * obstruents distinguish voicing
      * sonorants typically voiced
      * ex: final devoicing, extremely common cross-linguistically
        * !! expect to be on midterm
  * consonant place
    * labial -- bilabial and labio-dental consonants
      * labiodentals patten with bilabials but not with dentals
    * coronal -- dental, alveolar, postalveolar, retroflex, palatals
    * dorsals -- velar, uvular (back parts)
    * laryngeal -- glottal
  * manner
    * stops
    * fricatives
    * affricates
    * nasals
    * flaps
    * trills
    * **lateral** approximants
    * approximants
    * oral consonants = stops + fricatives + affricates + flaps + trills + laterals + approximants = C - nasals
    * vowels are usually oral but can be nasal
    * liquids = flap + trill + lateral + alveolar approximant [ɹ], retroflex approximant [ɻ] -- 'r' or 'l' like
      * uvular fricative is not a liquid
      * subset of sonorants
    * glides = approximants that are not liquids [w j]
    * rhotics =  r, ɾ, ɹ, ɻ, ʀ, ʁ, ɽ, and ɺ.
      * "r sounds"
  * voicing
    * voiced [b m w v ð d z n ɾ l ɹ ʒ d͡ʒ j g ŋ ɦ]
    * voiceless [p f θ t s ʃ t͡ʃ k ʔ h]
    * sonorants = vowels + voiced
  * vowel
    * high vowels [i y ɨ ɯ u ɪ ʊ]
    * low vowels [æ a ɑ]
      * a is a low central vowel in this course
    * mid vowels [e o ə ɛ ʌ ɔ]
      * in english ʌ is a central vowel
    * front vowels [i y e ɛ æ]
    * back vowels [ɯ u ʊ o ʌ ɔ ɑ]
    * central vowels [ɨ ə a]
    * rounding 
      * rounded [y ʊ u o ɔ ]
      * unrounded [i e ɛ æ ɪ ɨ ə a ɯ ʌ ɑ]
  * natural classes is closed under intersection, NOT UNION
    * front rounded vowels
    * voiced obstruents
    * retroflex liquids
    * oral sonorants
    * non-high vowels
    * non-fricative rhotics
* evidence for natural classes
  * seen how allophones are phonetically similar, usually form natural class
    * exclusion of other segments
  * sound patterns generally show evidence of natural classes
  * phonological rules can take a variable of natural classes
* doing an anaysis
  * look at environments - edge
  * make generalizations
    * preceding segment
    * following segment
    * word edge
* minimal rule
  * voiced stop -> fricative / V _ V (voicing is unchanged)
