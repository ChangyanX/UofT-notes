* Prosody -- Supra-segmental properties
  * Stress
  * Tone
  * Length
* Segmental vs suprasegmental
  * Languages have phonological patterns that are not contained within a single segment
  * Example: object (N)/object (V)
    * This example clearly do not differ in segments, but difference is non-segmental.
    * Not all languages have this **stress** pattern and not even consistent English
  * Cantonese tone
  * Vowel length in Dinka
* Languages prefer asymmetries
  * asymmetrical patterns are easier for the brain to process
  * asymmetries if we compare different syllables
    * some syllables behave differently from others

## Stress  
* stressed syllables
  * a little longer than unstressed
  * higher intensity
  * **higher pitch**
  * different, more vowels
  * different consonants
  * both phonetically and phonologically encoded
  * one stressed syllable per word, any number of unstressed syllables
  * showing non-existence is much harder than existence, so it is hard to say if there are languages without stress.
  * pitch is defined by the frequency at which vocal folds vibrate
    * stressed syllables have higher pitch than unstressed, all other things being equal
    * singing is manipulation of pitch
    * we use pitch to convey phonemic meaning in english, i.e permit (N), permit (V)
    * pitch can change over time
    * pitch is only realized on voiced segments!
      * vowels
      * sonorants
      * voiced obstruents
* vowel quality
  * schwa is only possible in unstressed positions in english
  * caret only possible in stressed positions in english
  * more stressed vowels in catalan, but only [i, schwa, u] in unstressed
    * vowel reduction
  * much easier to hear more stressed vowels than in unstressed positions
* consonants are affected by stress
  * allophones of /t/ in english
* asymmetry between some syllables compared to other syllables
* stressed syllables are "more prominent" compared to unstressed syllables
* distribution of stress
  * in many languages stress is not predictable
    * stress is thus lexical, part of the phonological representation of words
    * english has predictable stress for the vast majority of words, but we will assume that it is lexical because the patterns are complex
  * stress is marked as ' in ipa, the beginning of the stressed **syllable**
    * ex ['stʌmək]
  * in monosyllables we do not need to mark stressed, but does not mean they are not stressed.
    * 'queue' [kju]
* How do we know where stress is?
  * may be difficult, but the best strategy is to try to pronounce the word with a stress on different syllables
* Can we have more than one stress per word?
  * Many languages know more than one level of stress
  * Primary stress is the "main" stress
  * Secondary stress is another stress in a word, but is less audible
  * secondary stress is marked with `,`, a line on the bottom
    * will not be asked in this class
* Stress can change within the paradigm (plural)
  * this stress may not be predictable either
* Stress can be predictable in some languages
  * initial stress (stress on first syllable)
    * 50+ languages have initial stress
  * peninitial stress (stress on second syllable)
    * 12 languages have peninitial stress
  * postpeninitial stress (stress on third syllable)
    * 2 languages are known to have post-peninitial stress
      * azkoitia
      * basque
  * antepenultimate stress (stress on third to last syllable)
    * 7 languages 
  * penultimate stress (stress on second to last syllable)
    * 50+ languages
  * final stress (stress on last syllable)
    * 50+ languages have final stress
  * stress is never aligned with the beginning of the word
  * languages don't count (counting to 3 isn't really 'counting', we only look at before the 2nd, looking at first)
* Rules can refer to stress
  * Initial stress: \(\sigma \to \text{stressed} / \# \_ \)
  * Peninitial stress: \(\sigma \to \text{stressed} / \# \sigma \_\)
  * Postpeninitial stress: \(\sigma \to \text{stressed} / \# \sigma \sigma \_\)
  * Antepenultimate stress: \(\sigma \to \text{stressed} / \_ \sigma \sigma \#\)
  * Penultimate stress: \(\sigma \to \text{stressed} / \_ \sigma \#\)
  * Final stress: \(\sigma \to \text{stressed} / \_ \#\)
* Not all stress can be expressed with one rule
  * may have rules for monosyllabic, disyllabic, and elsewhere rules for example "closest to postpeninitial stress"

## Tone
* Pitch refers to frequency of vocal fold vibration
* F0 is the "fundamental frequency" -- frequency at which vocal folds vibrate
* Single segment may differ in terms of F0
* Only voiced segments have pitch because vocal folds must be vibrating
* Faster vibration = higher F0
* F0 is variable, pitch is F0 over time
* Languages use pitch to constrast words, phrases and sentences
* About 70% of the worlds languages have contrastive tone
  * Mandarin Chinese is one example
* Some languages only allow stressed syllables to have tones
* How do we represent tones?
  * Level tones
    * High \(\text{\'o}\)
    * Low \(\text{\`o}\)
    * Mid \(\text{\=o}\)
  * Contour tones
    * HL (Falling) \(\text{\^o}\) (acute + grave)
    * LH (Rising) \(\text{\v o}\) (grave + acute)
  * Can have more than 3 level tones, written with more the one acute or grave diacritic.
  * Can have more complex contours, such as Mandarin or Cantonese
* English does not have phonemic tone
  * it has stress (with pitch to indicate)
  * intonation (tone at the level of the sentence)
    * answer, question, reminder intonation
    * sentence-level contrast in pitch
    * semantic information, not phonemic information
  * pretty much all languages have intonation, **even tonal languages**
* tone and stress can interact!

## Length
* short versus long vowels
* singleton vs geminate consonants
* in many languages vowels do not differ wrt length
  * no minimal pairs of the same vowel that would differ in length
* vowels can differ in duration, stress often lengthens vowels phonetically
* Two triangles are used to mark vowel length (ː) 
* geminate consonants
  * some languages allow geminates of all kinds, in other languages only voiceless consonants can geminate
