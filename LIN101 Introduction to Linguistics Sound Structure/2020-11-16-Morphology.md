# 2020-11-16 Morphology

* A word is a core linguistic concept
* Understand meaning and sound structure by studying the make up of words
* Morphology is the study of the composition of words/word structure
  * how are words formed?
  * what is the relationship to other words within the same language
  * what do words consist of?
* Words are the smallest free form in the language
  * Can stand in their own in isolation
  * No fixed position wrt other words
  * Can appear at beginning, middle, end of sentence
  * different levels/kinds of structure
  * phonologically (sound) or morphologically (semantics) analyzed
  * aka **lexeme**
* Morphemes
  * Smallest unit that carries meaning
  * meaning of words depends on meaning of individual constituent morphemes
  * Some words are only one morpheme long
    * do, tell, door, black, soon, playtypus
  * Some have multiple morphemes
    * tell -ing, cat -nip, platypus -es
  * Can have different phonological shapes
    * one segment
    * one syllable
    * two syllables
    * longer
  * morphemes may be phonologically identical
    * -s can be
      * pluralizer: dog-s
      * 3rd person singular verb: tell-s
      * posessive: John-s
  * one morpheme may have multiple realisations
    * pl -s
      * dogs: dɑg**z**
      * cats: kæt**s**
  * Plural may have different realizations
    * tomato[z]
    * oxen
    * moose
* Allomorphs
  * Realization of a morpheme in a particular context,
  * Context can be different
    * phonological (-s, -z, -əz)
    * lexical (-en, etc: irregular exceptional)
  * English PLURAL allomorphy
    * [-əz] after sibiliants
    * [-s] after other voiceless obstruents
    * [-z] elsewhere
    * [-aɪ] latinate plural ??
    * [-ən] dutch plural ??
  * Variant allomorphs
    * platypuses
    * platypus
    * platypi
    * platlypodes
* Distinguishing morphemes
  * Content morphemes
    * referential meaning (thing, action, quality)
  * Functional morpeheme
    * structural, grammatical info
    * specification
    * (and, un-, -ed, -ness, the, with)
  * Free morphemes
    * can appear on their own in a word
  * Bound morphemes
    * can only appear with other morpehemes
    * -ed, un-, -ed
    * -ish is slowly becoming a free morpheme
* Most content morphemes are free and most function morphemes but there are exceptions
  * cran- berry (bound content morpheme)
  * the (free functional morpheme)
* Affixes
  * prefixes: before root
  * suffixes: after root
  * infix: inside root
    * expletive infixation
  * inflectional
    * indicate gramatical information
      * govern, govern -s, govern -ed, govern -ing
  * derivational
    * changes meaning, grammatical category
      * govern, govern -or, govern -ment
* roots are content morpehemes
* affixes are function morphemes
* stem is the root + derivational affixes
* derivation
  * not always productive (cant always produce new words)
    * -hood doesn't attach to all nouns
  * meaning can be unpredictable (neighbourhood vs fatherhood)
  * can add multiple derivational affixes
* inflection
  * almost fully productive (always able to create new words)
    * irregular allomorphs may exist
  * creates paradigms
  * **meaning is predictable**
  * only a few in English
    | Suffix  | Meaning  | Example                        |
    | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
    | -s      | PL       | sailors, tigers, tress         |
    | -'s     | POSS     | sailor's, tiger's, tree's      |
    | -s      | 3P       | shaves, illustrates            |
    | -ed     | PST      | shaved, showed, illustrated    |
    | -en/-ed | PST.PTCP | shaven, shown, illustrated     |
    | -ing    | PROG     | shaving, showing, illustrating |
    | -er     | CMPR     | bigger, wider, smaller         |
    | -est    | SUPL     | biggest, widest, smallest      |
  * Basque has a whole lot more inflectional suffixes (highly inflected)
* derivational affixes are almost always closer to the root than inflectionals
  * neighbourhoods not *neighbourshood
  * strong tendency, not a universal
* bound roots can be difficult to tease apart
  * containers has 4 morphemes
  * con- (conclude, confirm, concede)
  * -tain (retain, maintain, obtain)
  * -er (ruler, cooler, washer)
  * -s (PL)
* how we make words
  * derivation
  * zero derivation (conversion)
    * N/V difference from stress
    * ex. permit/permit
    * ex. a long drive
    * analyzed as a null affix  \(\emptyset\)
  * reduplication
    * copy a part of the root
    * the reduplicant is the affix that is added to the base (root)
    * english has two types of reduplication
      * contrastive focus
        * expresses prototypical meaning, common crosslinguistically
        * ex
          * home-home
          * London-London
          * book-book
          * living together-living together
      * shm-reduplication
        * irony, skepticism, disinterest
        * doubling, where initial onset replaced by shm
          * baby-shmaby
          * apple-shmapple
          * breakfast-shm(r)eakfast
  * truncation
    * remove part of the stem
    * dominik/domi (hypocoristic/pet name)
    * alexander/alex/xander
  * root-internal changes
    * change phonological content of the root
    * umlaut
      * sing/sang
      * sink/sank
      * goose/geese
  * prosodic changes
    * tone changes in basque
  * compounding
    * do not need affixes, just roots
    * ex
      * nationwide television network
      * fire hydrant
    * essentially one word
      * may be recursive, but we will consider this one word in this course
  * templates
    * in some languages, individual morphemes are just consonants or vowels, roots are not contiguous
    * arabic
      * k _i_ t _a_ b (SING)/ k _u_ t _u_ b (PL)
