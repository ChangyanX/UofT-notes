# 2020-11-23 Alternations

* Integrates everything from Phonetics, Phonology, and Morphology.
* Connecting Morphology and Phonology
* What is the "default" form for english PL?
  * dogs/cts
  * morphemes alternate because of phonology
  * morphemes are represented in the mind, affected by rules (grammar)
  * alternations reveal how morphology and phonology is connected
  * what data is stored, what rules are stored in the lexicon
    * what is derived by phonological rules
* Connecting morphology and phonology
  * Properties of a language without phonology?
    * All sequences of sounds would be equally likely
    * All instances of the same morpheme would sound the same
  * Hence in a world with phonology
    * Some sequences of sounds are more likely than others
    * Morphemes will alternate due to phonological rules
* What is the 'base' or 'default' form of PL?
  * realized in different way
* Words (not morphemes) have two forms
  * Underlying representation
    * stored in the brain
    * each morpheme has one UR
    * indicated by slashes / /
    * output of morphology
    * can not have rules that produce morphemes from scratch
  * Surface form
    * realization of an UR
    * directly observable
    * indicated by square brackets []
* -z is the underlying form, because it is the 'elsewhere'
  * -shwa + z after sibiliants
  * -s after voiceless obstruents
* generative phonology
  * language is innate
    * everyone has the ability to learn language
  * grammar is universal
    * all languages have rules
    * all languages have syllables
    * syllable universals
    * all languages have similar phonologies
      * all languages have syllables, words, segments, features
      * all languages have similar processes, alternations, distributions
  * all languages have similar grammars
    * also extends to sign languages
      * has 'vowel-like' and 'consonant-like' concepts
  * each morpheme is stored in the lexicon
  * grammar is the set of operations
  * described by Chomsky and Halle (1968)
* phonological rule
  * UR -> Phonological Process [Surface Form]
  * ex. /-z/ PL
  * -z -> -schwa z / after sibilants
  * -s -> -s / after voiceless obstruents
  * -z elsewhere (not derived)
* phonological analysis
  * observe surface form directly
  * figure out UR
  * figure out rule
  * **do not propose rules that create morphemes from scratch**
* example
  * z -> s / voiceless - #
    * can we derive a more general rule?
  * PST shows the same pattern
    * d -> t / voiceless - #
  * Voicing assimilation
    * voiced obstruent -> voiceless / voiceless - #
    * we don't even need voiced! voiceless obstruents will apply vacuously
    * obstruent -> voiceless / voiceless - #
* how to do an analysis
  * look at surface forms, look at distribution and alternations
  * determine morpheme boundaries
  * determine rules
  * determine URs
* common rules
  * Final devoicing: obstruent -> voiceless / - #
  * Intervocalic voicing: obstruent -> voiced / V - V
  * Intervocalic lenition: 
    * makes a stop a fricative
    * fricative can become a sonorant
    * sonorant can become glottal stop or deleted
    * english: stops become flaps
    * tongue is lazy
  * Voicing assimilation: obstruent -> voiceless / voiceless - #
  * Place assimilation
  * Deletion
  * Epenthesis (segment insertion)
  * Palatalization 
    * preceding consonants become palatalized
    * front or high vowel becomes palatalized
    * velars may become post-alveolars
* Frequent mistakes
  * people write morphological rules
    * **rules cannot substitute whole morphemes!!**
    * ex. 'see' SG (rai), PL (raida)
      * can not have rule NULL -> da / - #
      * can not insert morphemes!
  * crazy rules
    * simple rules preferred over complex rules
    * Deletion: C -> NULL / - #
      * alternative epenthesis rule NULL -> k / Ci - a (this is bad!)
  * write specific rules
    * final devoicing vs
      * voiced obstruent C -> voicless / - #
      * voiced obstruent -> voiceless obstruent / V - #
      * z - s / - # 
  * unspecific epenthesis
    * output of a rule must be a valid segment or a null segment
    * invalid rule: NULL -> V / C - C
      * V is unpronounceable
* english schwa epethensis: NULL -> schwa / sibilant - sibilant
* morphology and phonology interact
  * morphemes have a single mental representation that may be realized different depending on environment
  * different pronounciations of same morpheme are consequence of the phonological grammar
