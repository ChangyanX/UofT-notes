* **What is linguistics**
  * scientific discipline focusing on human language
    * speech and speech-like communication (sign language)
    * units and structure
* **What do linguists do and don't do**
  * a person who specializes in linguistics
    * a scientist that studies language
  * interested as language as scientists, not necessarily language learners
  * understand how languages work, not to learn language
  * linguists **do not** tell people how to use language
  * try to explain why speakers use language the way they do
  * use the scientific method
    * observe
    * hypothesis, theories, predictions
    * experiment
    * analysis
  * linguists never say something is "bad grammar" or "grammatically incorrect"
* **What is language**
  * sounds and signs that constitute meaning, as understood by a community
  * language is not a set of memorized sentences
  * it is a set of rules (**grammar**) and words
  * infinite amount of sentences (**creativity**)
  * we can talk about things that are not present, have happened in the past, will happen in the future, or will never happen (**displacement**)
  * animal communication does not have all these properties
    * bees waggle dance has meaning, has structure (grammar)
      * can not talk about politics, animals, things about things that haven't happened (lack of displacement)
      * creativity is very limited.
  * creativity is not random
    * To walk you need to be animate
      * "??The desk walked"
      * "??Linguistics walked"
    * "un" can only be added to adjectives
      * "*undesk"
    * can make up words if they follow the sound properties of the language
      * "flip"
      * "blusk"
    * some are odd in English
      * "*ksim"
      * "*rgor"
  * Limitation of creativity is **grammar**
    * The **rules** that determine the structure of the language
    * Grammar is a mental representation of **linguistic competence**
    * When a sentence does not obey these rules it is **ungrammatical**. This is not in the prescriptivist sense in that it is "ugly" or "non-standard", but an ungrammatical sentence could not possibly have meaning in the language

        |knowledge|competence|
        |---------|----------|
        |combination of sounds|phonological|
        |composition of words|morphological|
        |structure of sentence|syntactic|
        |meaning of sentence|semantic|
    * sign languages do not use sound, but display the same structures as other languages
    * three known **modalities** of language: spoken, signed, tactile signs
      * language can be communicated through touch
    * structure of grammar tells us about human mind
    * properties of grammar
      * generality - all languages have a grammar
      * parity - all languages are equally complex
      * universality - all grammars have deep structural similarity
        * all languages have words
      * mutability - grammars change over time
      * inaccessibility - linguistic competence is subconscious
        * most native speakers will not be aware of their grammars
    * word order is one such property
      * most languages are SOV and SVO
    * all languages have structure, which can be similar but not identical
      * there are a lot of assymetries
    * **universal grammar** is grammatical asymmetries common to all languages
    * **knowledge** that something is grammatical (acceptable) or ungrammatical
    * not all sentences always appear grammatical, problem of performance not competence
      * when we speak a sentence, we can often "glaze over" ungrammatical utterances
    * grammatical knowledge is not conscious. native speakers acquire grammar without effort. 
    * children do not learn language in school.
      * consider "fucking". we never learned this in school. this was acquired natively
        * fan-fucking-tastic
        * ala-fucking-bama
        * *fantast-fucking-ick
        * *ab-fucking-solutely
    * 
* **Why do we care about language**
  * product of the human brain
  * unique to humans
  * creative (can say a sentence that has never been uttered before)
  * displacement (things that are far or have never happened)
* **human universal**
  * every human uses a language
  * all languages are equally complex
  * every human society uses a language
  * no such thing as a primitive language
  * instinct, predisposition to learn and use a language
  * about 7000 languages currently spoken, not equally spread
* **what counts as a language**
  * every human speaks a slightly different language (**idiolect**)
  * similar idiolects are grouped in a **dialect**. everyone speaks some dialect.
  * dialects of the **same language** are generally mutually intelligible
  * what distinguishes a language is often a political question
* **descriptivism v. prescriptivism**
  * descriptivists only choose to describe. 
  * prescriptivists tell people how to speak a language "better"
  * consider the following pair
    1. "He didn't do nothing"
    2. "He didn't do anything"
  * the prescriptivist sense is that (2) is correct.
  * descriptivist would say both (1) and (2) are grammatical in english, depending on the dialect of the speaker. Both are possible.
  * No one would say `*nothing didn't do he`
  * consider the pairs, both are grammatical
    1. "She ain't here"
    2. "She isn't here"
  * consider the pairs
    1. Who did you eat with?
    2. With whom did you eat?
  * if we follow the prescriptivist rule not to end a sentence with a preposition, then (2) would be the correct way to phrase the thought but you see that (1) is much more common. But both are possible and thus "grammatical" in the descriptivist sense.
  * consider the pairs
    1. I'm done my homework
    2. I did my homework
  * In Canadian English, (1) and (2) are both possible. However a speaker of American English would not say (1).
  * Prescriptivism is about "one dialect being better than another" but as linguists, *there is no better way*.
  * A lot of variety in language
* **cognitive view**
  * patterns in language have to do with the way the human mind works
  * linguistics is a branch of **cognitive science** that is interested in how the mind processes language
  * we can observe the brain directly, but this is complicated. 
  * instead, we observe the **language and their patterns**.
* **Why study linguistics**
  * helps us see and understand immense diversity
  * helps us empower people
    * linguistic prescription
    * empower minority languages
  * complexity of human cognition
    * language is structured reveals how the human brain works
  * sharpens analytical skills
