* Summing over probabilities of atomic events still has exponential probabilities.
  * we don't need to look at the individual atomic events.

* Consider the chain \(E \to C \to A \to B \to H\) in the slides
  * \(P(a) = \Sigma_{c_i \in Dom(C)} Pr(a|c_i)Pr(c_i) = \Sigma(Pr(a|c_i)\Sigma_(Pr(c_i|e_i)Pr(e_i)\)
  * From the conditiional probability table, we have all of these numbers!
  * This is very similar to dynamic programming.
  * this is called a bayesian network
    * a graphical representation of the direct dependencies over a set of variables together with a set of conditional probability tables
  * A **bayes net** over \(\{X_1, ..., X_n\}\) consists of
    * a DAG whose nodes represents the variables
    * a set of CPTs (conditional probability tables) \(Pr(X_i) |Par(X_i)\) for each \(X_i\).
    * parents of a node is \(Par(X_i)\)
    * a family is a set of nodes consisting of \(X_i\) and its parents - CPTs are defined over families in the BN.
      * just parents, not the other ancestors
  * A bayes net specifies that the joint distribution over all the variables in the net can be written as a product decomposition
    * \(Pr(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n) = Pr(X_i|Par(X_n)) * P(X_{n-1} | Par(X_{n-1}) * ... * Pr(X_1 | Par(X_1))\)
  * ex
    * \(Pr(X_1, X_2, X_3) = P(X_3 | X_2)P(X_2)P(X_1)\).
  * It is always possible to construct a bayes net representing over variables using any ordering
    * take any ordering of variables
    * For each \(X_i\) remove from its conditioning set any variables \(X_j\) such that \(X_i\) is conditionally independent of \(X_j\) given the remaining variables.
