Consider a state space with ABCD, state space = A.

```
 A--->C
 |   /|
4| 3/2|9
 v /  v
 B--->D
   6
```

The optimal solution is ACBD,
Consider heuristic.
h(A) = 8
h(B) = 3
h(C) = 7
h(D) = 0


this heuristic is admissible, because every heuristic cost is less than the optimal cost 9.

In the first case, we don't do any cycle check.

1. `{<A>}`, \(f = g + h = 0 + 8 = 8\)
2. `{<A, C>, <A, B>}` \(f_{AC} = 1 + 7, f_{AB} = 4 + 3\)
3. `{<A, C>, <A, B, C>, <A, B, D>}` \(f_{ABC} = 6 + 7, f_{ABD} = 10 + 0\)
4. `{<A, B, C>, <A, B, D>, <A, C, B>, <A, C, D>}` \(f_{ACB} = 3 + 3, f_{ACD} = 10 + 0\)

Then we expand `ACB` to find `ACBD`, which has cost 9, which is the cheapest path.

Note that on the third step we already had a path, but we don't stop because we haven't proved it was optimal.

When we expand `ACB`, notice we get a path `<A, C, B, C>`, which **is pruned by path checking**.

With cycle checking, in step 4, we prune `ABC`, since we have already reached `C` from `AC` cheaper. We also prune `ACD`, because `ABD` is the same price. 


Notice the sequence of nodes expande

```
<A>, <A, B>, <A, C>, <A, C, B>, <A, C, B, D>
 8      7       8        6         9
```

Notice that the f values of sequence is not nondecreasing. This looks like \(h\) is not monotonic, how can we prove this?

A consistent heuristic obeys the following definition: 
the heuristic estimate can not decrease anymore than the cost of the action, that is a consistent heuristic obeys \(h(n_1) \leq c(a) + h(n_2)\).

Alternatively, along a path, the f values of the prefixes are non-decreasing.

This can be proved by induction.
