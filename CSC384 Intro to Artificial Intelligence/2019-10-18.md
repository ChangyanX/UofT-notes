## Search Space Representation
* \(n\) people across a river
  * A set of \(n\) people \(\{P_1, ..., P_n\}\)
  * \(Weight(P_i)\) is the weight of \(P_i\)
  * Everyone starts on the right hand side of the river
  * What states do we use, and what actions do we use?
    * A set of states \([S]\)
    * A set of actions \(S \to S\)
    * A goal state \(S\)
    * A start state \(S\)
  * We have a boat, \(W_B\), max weight of the boat.
  * What do we need to know in a state?
    * A set of people \(L : \{\text{People on the left}\}\)
    * A set of people \(R : \{\text{People on the left}\}\)
    * Position of the boat \(B : \{l \text{ or } r\}\)
    * Since \(L\) and \(R\) are complements, we don't really need both sets but it's easier to reason about with both sets.
  * Initial State
    * \(R = \{P_1, ..., P_n\}\)
    * \(L = \emptyset\)
    * \(B = r\)
  * Goal State
    * \(R = \emptyset\)
    * \(L =  \{P_1, ..., P_n\}\)
  * Actions applicable to \(S\)
    * If \(B = r\)
      * Let \(m \subseteq R\), such that \(m \neq \emptyset\), \(\Sigma_{P_i \in m} Weight(P_i) \leq W_B\).
      * Then the successor state is
        * \(B = l\)
        * \(R = R \setminus m\)
        * \(L = L \cup m\)
    * If \(B = l\)
      * Let \(m \subseteq L\), such that \(m \neq \emptyset\), \(\Sigma_{P_i \in m} Weight(P_i) \leq W_B\).
      * Then the successor state is
        * \(B = r\)
        * \(R = R \cup m\)
        * \(L = L \setminus m\)

## Sudoku Board
Let \(K\) be the number of unfilled cells

Since \(h(n) = h^*(n)\), we have perfect heuristic knowledge...do we?

Consider the state


```
123
89X
  4
  5
  6
  7
```

We have an \(n\), but \(h^*(n) = \infty\); this can not lead to a solution.
For dead ends \(h^*(n) = \infty \neq K\).
