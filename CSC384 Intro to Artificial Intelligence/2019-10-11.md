* Question 7 Heuristic
  * minimum cost spanning tree
    * prims
    * manhattan to compute distance between every pair of points
    * looks for a tree that connects all the points
    * construct the tree greedily where the sum of the costs is minimal
    * tree does not backtrack
    * break ties by lowest h value
* 5-Queens Problem
  * progressively prune constraints until you get DWO
* GAC (from midterm examples)
  * Variables
    * \(x, y, z, w\)
    * \(Dom[x] = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\)
    * \(Dom[y] = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\)
    * \(Dom[z] = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}\)
    * \(Dom[w] = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\)
  * Constraints
    * \(C_1(x, y, z) \iff x = y + z\)
    * \(C_2(x, w) \iff w > x\)
    * \(C_3(x, y, z, w) \iff w = x + y + z\)
  * How do we do GAC on this?
  * GAC Set: \(\{C_1, C_2, C_3\}\)
    * Not yet Arc-consistent
    * Try the smallest constraint first.
      * \(C_2\)
        * \(\{C_1, \sout{C_2}, C_3\}\)
        * \(w = 1, x = ?\) This is no good.
        * \(w = 2, 3, 4, x = 1\) OK.
        * \(x = 1, 2, 3, 4, w = 5\) Ok.
        * Now we add all constraints with W back into GAC set, but \(C_2\) is done, and \(C_3\) is on the set.
      * \(C_1\), \(Dom[w] = \{\sout{1}, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\) \(\{\sout{C_1}, \sout{C_2}, C_3\}\)
        * \(x = \sout{1}, 2, 3, 4\). \(x\) Can not be 1. 
        * \(y = 1, 2, 3, \sout{4}\) Can not be 4
        * \(z = 1, 2, 3, \sout{4}\) Can not be 4.
        * We need to put \(C_2\) back on the list.
      * \(C_3\) \(Dom[w] = \{\sout{1}, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\),\(Dom[x] = \{\sout{1}, 2, 3, 4\}\), \(Dom[y] = \{1, 2, 3, \sout{4}\}\), \(Dom[z] = \{1, 2, 3, \sout{4}\}\) \(\{\sout{C_1}, C_2, C_3\}\)
        * \(w = \sout{2}, \sout{3}, 4, 5\)
        * \(x = 2, 3, \sout{4}\) Remember 1 is puned
        * \(y = 1, 2, \sout 3, \sout 4\)
        * \(z = 1, 2 \sout 3, \sout 4\)
        * And we need to add \(C_2\) and \(C_1\) back.
      * \(C_2\) \(w = \{4, 5\}, x = \{2, 3\}\)
        * Verifies without pruning
      * \(C_1\) \(y = \{1, 2\}, z = \{1, 2\}\)
        * Verifies without pruning
      * Now we have the new domains.
