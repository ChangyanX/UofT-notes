* What is the probability that something will happen given some other probability?
* We can normalize the vector [Pr(d, h, i), Pr(-d, h, -i)]
* Pr(d|A, B), etc. etc. are probability tables
* Table of values computed by VE factors
* Original probabilities that appear int he summation are also tables of values
* Factors may not necessarily be conditional probability tables
* product of f and g h = f * g is defined h(X, Y, Z) = f(X, Y) * g(Y, Z)
* replace each factor f in F mentioning avariable in E with restictions f E - e


## Example

```
A --->+
      +-->C--->D
B --->+
```

Factors are \(f_1(A), f_2(B), f_3(A, B, C), f_4(C, D)\)
My query is \(P(A)\). Evidence is \(D = d\), and the elimination order is \(C, B\).

Restriction: replace \(f_4(C, D)\) with \(f_5(C) = f_4(C, d)\)

Step 1. Compute and add \(f_6(A, B) = \Sigma_c\)
Step 2. ...

## Systematic way Buckets

every CPT is it s own factor

ordering; C, F, A, B, E, D

```
A--->--+      +-->E---+
       |-->C--|       |-->F
B--->--+      +-->D---+
```

D is the query.
(drop them off from the top)

1. C: \(f_3(A, B, C), f_4(C, D), f_5(C, E)\)
2. F: \(f_6(E, D, F)\)
3. A: \(f_1(A)\)
4. B: \(f_2(B)\)
5. E: 
6. D:

Then, eliminate rows one by one. 
1. \(\Sigma_C f_3(A, B, C), ... = f_7(A, B, D, E)\)

Then 

3. A: \(f_1(A), f_7(A, B, D, E)\)

Elimination of F
1. \(\Sigma_C f_6(E, D, F), ... = f_8(E, D)\)

go on and on until we get \(f_11(D)\) which is the final answer (after normalization)

## Hypergraph
* Hyperedge is a set of vertices that 'spans' a bunch of nodes
* Hypergraph of Bayes net
* each set of variables a factor is over is a hyperedge (scopes of CPTs)
