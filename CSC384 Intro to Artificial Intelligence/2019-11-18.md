* Pr(X=d) ~= particle with value d / total # of particles

* Ensure particles accurately approximate the real distribution 
  * Elapse -> Weight -> Resample
* Track samples of states rather than explicit distribution.
* move particles according to transition probabilities
* weighted by evidence

* Dynamic Bayes Net
  * track multiple variables over time, using multiple sources of evidence
  * repeat a fixed bayes net structure at each time
  * dynamic bayes nets are the generalization of HMMs
* weights might become very small
* sum of the weighs and good samples divided by the total weight of the samples.

## Knowledge Representation
* people thought with symbolic representation you could build a lot of AI systems
* didn't take uncertainty very seriously
  * neural nets have limitations
    * explainability
  * can we add logical ideas into neural nets
* What is knowledge
* information about the world we inhabit
  * physical and mental world
  * abstract mental constructs
* mental attitudes and feelings
* What is representation
  * symbols standing for things in the world
