* Rationality 
  * Taking actions/making decisions that increase the chance of achieving predifined goals
  * Rationality is measured by the outcome -- the decision/action that is made-- not the process of computing the decision
  * Measure the utility of the outcome of the decision
  * Decisions may not be deterministic
    * Still rational that it increased the probability of doing well
  * Maximize utility


* Difference over trying or expectation
  * don't have full control or knowledge of our problem domain
  * don't know precisely what the effects of our actions will be.
* in some contexts we can simplify by *assuming we have full knowledge/control*
* AI is part of computer science
  * we try to construct systems whose *computation* achieves or approximats
