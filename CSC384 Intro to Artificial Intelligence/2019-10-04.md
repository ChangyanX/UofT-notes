* Tiebreaking can make an exponential difference
  * Consider a search tree that is a binary tree, and every single leaf node satisfies.
    * Every action costs 1, so every path is optimal
    * A trivial heuristic can be just the level of the tree (a perfect heuristic)
  * ```
             A
            / \
           /   \
          /     \
         /       \
        B         C
       / \       / \
      /   \     /   \
     D     E   F     G
    / \   / \ / \   / \
    H I   J K L M   N  O
    ```
    If we expand nodes based on f value, we will keep going in circles, looking at all nodes. If we instead use h or g values to tie break, we will essentially force the search to go down.

    If we expand this well get OPEN `<A>, <A, B>, <A, C>`. We don't want to exhaust OPEN by not tiebreaking!

* Alpha-beta
  * If you are a MAX player, beta is never updated
    * alpha is always the maximum value child of what got passed you
    * If alpha is better than beta, we go back
  * If you are a MIN child, alpha is never changed
    * beta is always updated to the min of the value
    * if were less than the past alpha we go back.
