Two astronomers make measurements \(M_1\) and \(M_2\) the number of stars \(N\). There is a small probability \(e\) that there can be an error of + or - 1. There is also a probability \(f\) that the telescope is out of focus. There are 2 boolean variables \(F_1, F_2\), if \(F_i = True\) it's out of focus. If its out of focus, we'll undercount the stars by 3 or more.

Which of these nets are accurate?

1. ```
   F1    F2
   |     |
   v     v
   M1   M2
    \   /
     \ /
      v
      N
   ```

This network is not in causal order! How many stars we measure in the sky does not affect how  many stars in the sky there are. But whether or not we're in focus or not does affect how many we measure. **This does not mean the network is wrong**. The network represents some distribution that tells the story.

The ordering F1, F2, M1, M2, N respect this net. If we use this ordering, we have the chain rule. Pr(F1, F2, M1, M2, N) = Pr(N | F1, F2, M1, M2) * Pr(M2 | M1, F1, F2) * Pr(M1 | F1, F2) * Pr(F2 | F1) * Pr(F1)

Can we simplify to

Pr(N | M1, M2) * Pr(M2 | F2) * Pr(M1|F1) * Pr(F1) * Pr(F2)

The simplification of Pr(M2 | M1, F1, F2) to Pr(M2 | F2) is not possible because M2 depends on M1! If M1 measures 6, we can expect 5, 6, or 7. So this network does not follow the story.

1. ```
   F1  N F2
    | / \ |
    v     v
    M1   M2
    ```

    This network is in causal ordering, but that does not necessaryly mean its correct!
    
    We'll use the ordering F1, F2, N, M1, M2, notice that the parents are before the children
