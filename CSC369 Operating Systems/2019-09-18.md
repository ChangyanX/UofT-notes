# 2019-09-18 Very Simple FS

* Divide whole disk into fixed blocks
  * 4KB blocks
  * 64 blocks
  * total 256KB
* Reserve last 56 blocks as data
  * 4KB = 32K blocks, we have overkill
* 5 blocks to store inodes
  * 5 * 4KB / 128B (per inode) = 160 files

## Allocation Structures
  * We need an inode bitmap and data bitmap
  * 1 block per bitmap
  * 2 blocks
  * Each bitmap can store data for 32K blocks
## Superblock
  * Magic number VSFS
  * number of inodes and data blocks
  * inode table start block

## Reading (read from inode 32)
  * inode table begins at block 3, and inodes are 128B
  * Address of inode 32 is 12KiB (block 3) + 32 * 128= 16KiB
    * Which blocks have the data?
  * If inode contains 15 direct pointers (max 60KiB), just read blocks
### Indirect Pointers
  * Pointer that points to a block that contains more pointers
  * First 14 pointers are direct, 15th is indirect
  * Indirect pointers point to a block (4KiB) which can hold 1Ki Pointers, so 1K extra blocks
    * 4K * (14 + 1K) = 4152KiB
  * If we use double indirect pointers...
    * 13 from direct pointers
    * 1024 from indirect pointers
    * 1024 * 1024 from double indirect = 1Mi blocks
    * 4Ki * (13 + 1024 + 1024 * 1024) =~ 4.0GB


## Extents
  * an extent is a disk pointer + length of blocks (allocates few blocks in a row)
  * just need a pointer to every several blocks
  * less flexible than pointers
  * smaller amount of metadata from file
  * ext4, HFS+, NTFS, XFS

## Links
  * inode has just 1 pointer to first data block of the file, first block points to next, etc.
  * works poorly if we want the last block
  * uses in-memory file allocation table indexed by block address
