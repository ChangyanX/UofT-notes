# 2019-10-25 Synchronization Primitives

* Locks
  * Only 1 thread at a time in a critical section
  * Minimal semantics
  * Flavours
    * Mutexes
    * Spinlocks
      * Thread that doesn't get the lock 'spins'
      * waste of CPU
      * overhead from putting thread to sleep/waking it up
      * assumes lock will be available very soon
        * hybrid mutex opt: behaves like a mutex when spinlock is unavailable
* Semaphores
  * Allow multiple threads to access a resource 
  * Generalization of locks
  * `sem_create` does heap allocation
    * why doesnt semaphore have static inits?
    * `sem` can be arbitrary sized.
* Conditional Variables
  * Used in implementing monitors
    * only a single process executes inside monitor
  * locks + conditional variable
    * thread can notify another thread that a condition is satisfied
  * alternative is to poll CPU
  * `wait`, `signal`, `broadcast`
  * special mutex ith condition
  * `wait`
    * atomically release mutex and start waiting for `cond` to be signaled
    * when signaled, acquire mutex and stop waiting
    * signalling thread must release `mutex` after calling `signal` before `wait` can return.
  * `signal` as soon as condition is satisfied
    * "as soon as buffer was written, signal thread to wake"
  * avoid needing to poll condition
* monitor
  * abstraction that encapsulates shared data and operations that only 1 thread at a time can access
    * 'black box'
  * we need locks and CVs
  * say the buffer is empty within monitor, and consumer 1, producer 1 and consumer 2 are in the ready queue
    * consumer 1 enters, and calls wait, goes into "wait queue"
    * producer 1 enters buffer, signals consumer 1, bringing consumer 1 back into the ready queue
      * buffer not empty
    * who gets to go first? consumer 1 or consumer 2?
      * consumer 1 went into monitor first
    * mesa vs hoare semantics
      * mesa - can pick either consumer 1 or consumer 2. doesn't matter
        * c2 goes in, emptying buffer. c1 goes in and goes back into the wait queue
        * mesa is the default semantics (`while`)
      * hoare semantics
        * signaled thread gets priority to run
        * condition guaranteed to hold (since signaled), so we only need `if` in thread.
