# Pointers
* every variable has a memory address
* Accessed with an address of operator `&`

* **pointers** are variables that store memory addresses
  * `int x = 42`
  * `int *x_ptr = &x;`
  * `int *heap_ptr = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int))`
* The value a pointer refers to is *dereferenced* with `*`.
  * `*x_ptr == 42`
* `NULL` is the `0` value for addresses.
  * check pointers for `NULL` before dereferencing.

## Pass by value/reference
* C only allows one value to be returned
  * If variables are passed into a function by value, any chances will not be seen outside the function
  * If pointers are passed into a function, any changes made to the value will be seen (passing by reference)
    * The pointer itself is still a *value*.
  
## Arrays
* arrays are almost the same as pointer.
  * Cast the array to a pointer, see `int *x_ptr = x_arr`
  * `sizeof(int [n]) != sizeof(int*)`
  
## Allocation
* When allocating heap in kernel space, use `kmalloc` / `kfree`.
