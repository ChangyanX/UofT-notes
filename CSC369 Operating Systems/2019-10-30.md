* Virtual memory
  * CPU generates logical address as program executes
  * memory system must see physical memory
  * physical memory is more complicated
    * program doesnt start at address 0
    * 2^32 is 4GiB so how did we run processes on 32bit machines when we had less than 1GiB physical memory 
      * not even vaddress space of 1 process can fit
    * Only have 16GiB physical address space. Does that mean I can only run 4 processes at a time?
* Memory hierarchy
  * Registers 1 KB
  * L1 32-128KB (0.5ns)
  * L2 2-8MB (7ns)
  * DRAM (4-64GB) (100ns)
  * Disk (SSD 1 000 000ns, HDD 10 000 000 ns)
* Goals
  * transparency
    * a program should nto need to know how memory is virtualized
    * program has illusion of using all of physical memory
  * efficiency
    * time programs shouldnt run much more slowly
    * space
      * minimize size of structs needed to support
  * protection
    * process should not be able to access other process' memory
* Should not need to know where in physical memory program is stored
* programmer shouldn't worry if chunks of program or data is on the disk
* create illusion of having more memory than dram
* we need to translate virtual memory to physaddr space
* Looking awfully like FS.

## Fixed partitioning
* Each process gets a fixed partition to use
* Divide physical memory in to 8M regions
* OS occupies separate partition
* each process granted a partition
* problems
  * Internal fragmentation
* if process is smaller than partition, this wastes memory
* if program needs more memory than the partition size, programmer has to deal with that (overlays)

## Fixed, unequal partitions
* Queue-per-partition
* unequal size of partition and process takes smallest block of memory

## More dynamic partition
* Allocate as you go
* External fragmentation
* could move processes around on memory
  * compaction
  * requires processes to be relocatable
    * need to update pointers and addresss
* need to know maximum size of process at load time
  * processes grow over time
  * how do you share memory
  * compaction is time consuming
* placement heuristics
  * first fit
    * choose first block that is large enough, or where previous search ended (next-fit)
  * best fit
    * choose block closest in size to request
  * worst fit
    * choose largest block
  * quick fit
    * keep multiple free lists for common block sizes
* address binding
  * programs need to be in memory to execute
  * binary is loaded into process's addr space
  * needs memory for code and data
* program addrs need to be translated to physaddrs
* addr translation is the process of linking variable names to logical addrs
  * addr translation at load time
  * addr translation at exec time
    * depend on MMU to translate virtual address to physical address on every instruction execution
* everything relative to 0
  * 2 registers base and limit
    * add base to virtadd
    * check limit for last legal addres sof process
