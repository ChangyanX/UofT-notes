* NTFS
  * MFT record for a 3-run 9 block file
  * We need the extents to be large enough to allocate things.
    * if we degenerate to 1 block runs...
    * since the records are 1KB, for small files we can store it in the metadata
* We need an abstract layer for the OS
  * VFS 
  * `vps_open`, `vps_close`, which abstract over filesystems
  * user-level programmer interacts with filesystem through syscalls.
* How do we guarantee consistency of on-disk storage
* How do we optimize writes
* FFS observation 1
  * `fsck`  post-crash recovery process scans fs and restores consistency
    * all data blocks pointed to by inodes must be marked and allocated
    * inode link count must match
    * all allocated inodes must be inb some dir entries
  * log updates
    * allows rollback/rollforward
    * we don't get ACID, but close.
