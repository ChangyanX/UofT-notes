* Paging divides memory into fixed sized chunks
* Extra effects of loading in pages to memory
* Illusion of using all physical memory
* address translation
* CPU can only manipulate registers
  * cpu needs to load values to and from memory

## Paging
* Partition memory into fixed sized chunks called **page frames** or **frames**
* Divide processes memory into chunks of the same size called **pages**
  * Logical memory called **pages**, physical memory are **frames**.
* Any page can be assigned to any page frame
* Restrict possible page frame sizes to powers of 2 to make address translation easier
* We can swap pages to disk when not needed

* Good virtualization of memory
  * need to translate physaddr to virtaddr
  * page table
* Each process in the OS has its own page table
* MMU can use page table to convert address formats
* Virtual addresses are now `page_number + page_offset`, where
  * `page_number = vaddr / page_size`
  * `page_offset = vaddr % page_size`
* `page_offset` is a function of page size, number of bits needed to address a byte within the page.
* `pages_number` is bytes we have left over.
* `page_number` is index to page table, that tells us start of the frame.
* physaddr can be calculated by `page_table[page_number] + page_offset`
* If `page_offset` is 10 bits, then we can address \(2^10 = 1024\) bytes!
* If `page_number` takes 6 bits, we can address \(2^6 = 64\) **pages**.
