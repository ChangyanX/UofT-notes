* How FUSE Works
  * File system in USErspace
  * LKM allowing userspace FS
  * Forwards requests to a daemon - userspace program that links with libfuse
  * Daemon implements callbacks corresponding to FS ops
    * `stat`, `read`, `write`, `mkdir`
  * Mounted FS appears like a regular FS.
* Generally syscalls call into a VFS, which abstracts over supported filesystems
