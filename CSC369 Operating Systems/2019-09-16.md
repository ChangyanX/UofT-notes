## How file systems use the disk to store files

Lets start with a raw unformatted disk of size 256KB

```
+-----------+
|   256KB   |
+-----------+
```
* FS define block size (choose 4KiB) = 64 blocks for our 256KB disk

```
+-+-+-+-+-+-+
| | | | | | |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+
| | | | | | |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```
* A superblock determines the location of the root directory
  * always at a well known location
  * type of fs
  * some other info

```
+-+-+-+-+-+-+
|S|F| | | | |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+
| | | | | | |
+-+-+-+-+-+-+
```

* A free map determines which blocks are free
  * allocate a block for one bit per block on disk
  * cached in mem for perf

```

## Contiguous Allocation
* Just store the files contiguously on the block
  * If we have a file of 5KB, and each block is 4KB, that will take up 2 blocks.
* Requires very little metadata
* All blocks of files located on disk

## Linked
* Each block points to the next, directory points to the first
* Does not require all the blocks to be stored contiguously.
* We need to know where the starting block is
* FAT uses linked allocation, but links are in File Allocation Table, not in the blocks.
* 
## Indexed
* Index block contains pointers to other blocks

## Inodes
* ext2 inodes are 128 bytes.
* Contains an array of pointers to the blocks that belong to the file
* Each inode contains 15 pointers
* The pointer at index 12 (single indirect pointer) points to a block to an array of pointers to data blocks. Blocks [0-11] are directly indexed.
* Index 13 is a double indirect pointer (disk block that is an array of pointers that points to data blocks)
* Index 14 is a triple indirect pointer
