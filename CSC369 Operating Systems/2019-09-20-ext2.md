* need to slice hd into blocks
* ext2 blocks are size 1024
  * `dd` does block partitioning
  * `mke2fs` writes the superblock/inodes/metadata/etc.
* MBR - *Master Boot Record* is stored in the first block of `ext2`, superblock is put in the 2nd block.
  * Used to determine how to load the OS
  * Block after superblock is Block group descriptor table
  * block bitmaps and inode bitmap
  * inode table

```c
#define EXT2_BLOCK_SIZE 1024

typedef struct ext2_super_block {
    unsigned int s_inodes_count;
    unsigned int s_blocks_count;
    ...
} ext_super_block;
```

* mmap takes the file and maps it to the memory mapped region of the process
  * when we mmap the file, we don't need to use sycalls to access file access.
  * Just a memory write, no syscalls
  * When we do `MAP_SHARED`, then all memory writes are immediately written to the file
  * In `MAP_PRIVATE`, the write will be cached into a copy-on-write memory page, and never persisted on disk.

* block group descriptor table
  * disks are split up into groups of blocks.
  * We want to keep files within a block group
    * block group descriptor table, and super block is copied across different block groups 
    * no copy of MBR

* How to read bitmap
  * Suppose inode bitmap is at block 5.
  * `unsigned char *inode_bits = (unsigned char*)(disk + 1024 * 4)`
  * loop through bytes, then loop through bits
  
* inode
  * does not contain file, but pointers to data of the file
  * `i_blocks` *does not tell you the block size in blocks*, but block size in **DISK SECTORS**, which is 512, **not 1024**.
