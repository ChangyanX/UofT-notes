* Producer/consumer problem
  * classic synchronization problem
  * implementation of a `pipe`
* Conditional variables
  * ADT that encapsulates pattern of "release mute, sleep, reacquire'
    * internal data is just a queue of waiting threads
  * `wait`, `signal` `broadcast`.
  * acquire a lock, and check if the cond is true
    * if not true, wait for cond to be true, and **release the lock.**
    * once it's awakened by `signal`, (or broadcast), it reacquires the lock.
      * when `wait` returns the lock will be held again.
* read write with conditional variables
  * 2 regular variables
    * 1 keeps track of # of readers
    * 1 keeps track of whether or not some thread is writing
  * reader
    * acquires mutex
    * checks writing. if no one is writing, increases readcount and releases the mutex
    * the second thread that finished will wake up writing thread
      * write thread will get mutex fro reader
    * increment writing and increment mutex
    *
