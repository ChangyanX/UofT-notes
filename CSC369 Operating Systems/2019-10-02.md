# 2019-10-02 SSD

* Replace rotating mechanical disk with NVRAM
* NAND Flash or batterybacked RAM

* Advantages are much faster, but flash may wear out.
* NAND flash: Read/write/erase.
* Data can not be modified in place. We can't overwrite something without an erase.
* A **page** is a unit of r/w and a block is a collection of pages.
* Uniform Random Access performance!
* Wear leveling is when you distribute the read writes to make sure the drive wears evenly
* TRIM is used to tell SSD which blocks are no longer used
* Wear leveling is now done internally by SSD
