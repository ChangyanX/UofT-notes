# 2019-10-11 Threads Tutorial

* locks
* threads let us do stuff in parallel
* thread must have `void*` return type and params
* Need some way to optimize threading factor (num_threads)
  * split number of elements depending on threads
  * thread creation overhead
  
\[
 Speedup = \frac{\texttt{exec\_seq}}{\texttt{exec\_par}}
\]

Where `exec_seq` is the execution time for sequential, and `exec_par` is the execution time in parallel for the same problem.
* destroying locked mutex is UB
