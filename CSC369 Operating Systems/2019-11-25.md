* sharing
  * private virtual address paces
  * mapping shared memory mapped at different virtaddr
    * be careful about pointers in that memory,  pointing out
* copy on write
  * defer large copies as long as possible, hoping to avoid them altogether
    * instead of copying pages, create shared mappings of parent page in child virtaddr space 
    * shared pages are protected in child
    * read happen as usual
      * writes generate a protection fault, trap to OS, copy page, change age mapping
    * vfork if the very next thing would cause exec
      * minimally set up process to call exec
  * memory mapped files
    * bind a file to the virtual memory region (mmap) in Unix
      * PTEs map virtaddrs to physical frames holding the data
      * virtaddr base + N refers to offsten N in file
      * can read or write at various offsets in file using memory ops
  * initially all pages map to file are invalid
    * OS reads a page from file when invalid page is accessed
    * OS writes when page is written to
  * file is essetially backing story for that region
    * virtaddrspace not backed b real file
  * reduces copying
  * doesn't generalize to streamed IO

* deadlock
  * root causes
  * resources are finite
  * processes wait if a resource they need is unavailable
  * resources may be held by other waiting processes
  * holding one lock and trying to acquire another lock
* conditions
  * mutual exclusion
    * only one process may use a resource at a time
  * hold and wait
    * holding a lock waiting to hold another
  * no preemption
    * no resource can be forcibly removed from a process holding it
  * circular wait
    * closed chain of processes exist, each process holds at least one resource needed by next process in chain
  * together these 4 conditions are necessary and sufficient for a deadlock.
    * circular wait implies hold and wait 
* dining philosophers
  * > 5 philosophers eating at a table with 1 chopstick each. 
  * > philosopher (i):
    > * do forever:
    >   * think
    >   * pick up left
    >   * pick up right
    >   * eat
    >   * put down left
    >   * put down right
    > * done
  1.  mutual exclusion
      * only one philosopher may have a chopstick at a given time  
  2.  hold and wait
      * philosopher holds a left chopstick, but right chopstick is in use, and is waiting  
  4.  no preemption
      * you can not take a chopstick out of another philospher's hand  
  5.  circular wait
      * everyone holds the left chopstick and is waiting for right chopstick to become available 
* can we break the hold and wait
  * wait until both are ready (?)
    * what if everyone's doing that at the same time
    * global lock
  * alternative
    * livelock
    * trylock -- grab a lock if available, otherwise try later
      * exponential backup
      * how ethernet is implemented
      * possible livelock
        * solution to livelock exists too
    * can we break no preemption
      * when is it safe to take  a resource away from nothe rthread
        * can one thread preempt a thread in a critical section
      * generally not feasible
    * consider if one philosopher picks up right chopstick first, circular wait is broken
      * impose total order to locking hierarchy then you can't get deadlock
    * what if we add one more chopstick?
      * usually not possible to add more solution
    * other strategeies
      * deadlock avoidance
        * use knowledge about resources that each process requests to avoid moving into state that might deadlock
      * deadlock detection
        * use graph algorithms to identify deadlock
      * deadlock recovery
  * most operating systems employ ostrich algorithm
  * no single strategy for dealing with deadlocks
  * modern OS virtualize most physical resources eliminate problem of finite resources
    * some logical resources can't be virtualized
    * protected by synchronization objects
