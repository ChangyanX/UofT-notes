* multi-level feedback queues
* scheduling goals
  * response time
  * proportionality
  * prevent starvation
  * priority
* how can we get to optimal?
* A priority \(p\) is associated with each thread.
* highest priority job selected from ready queue
  * can be preempty or non preemptive
* enforcement is tricky
  * low prority task may prevent high priority task from running
  * low priority may starve (never get to run)
* use a multi-level queue algorithm
  * have multiple ready queue
  * threads are **permanently assigned to a queue**
    * typically round robin within the queue
  * each queue has its own scheduling algorithm
  * another level of scheudling decides which queue to choose
  * usually priority based
* threads change behaviour over time, is assigning it permanently good?
* we want IO bound processes to be higher priority 
  * to be more responsive
  * waiting for some kind of response
* if a thread makes a syscall before using its full time quantum, IO bound
  * conversely, compute bound, we may want to lower priority
* all the jobs in the same queue are at "the same" priority
* priority inversion
  * low priority thread holds a lock and is pre-empted.
  * high priority thread that wants the lock can't run until the low priority thread runs again
  *
