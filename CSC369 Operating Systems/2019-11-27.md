* Security should be considered from the beginning
* Don't 'roll your own'
  * Don't trust an encryption algorithm that isn't public
* Make security easy for your users
* Social engineering is a real problem
* Authentication
  * What you know
    * passwords
  * What you have
    * multi-factor
  * What you are
    * biometrics
* buffer overflow
* strcpy
* speculative execution
* local exploit
  * physical access is compromised
* remote
  * exploit some network service
* buffer overflow
  * overflow some stack-allocated input buffer past the space allocated for input
  * overwrite return address with address of exploit code
  * overwrite next space in stack with exploit code
* XN bit - lock out stack space
* ASLR, stack randomization
* Network communication
  * Eavesdropping
* Asymmetric key (Diffie Hellman Merkle Key Exchange)
  * Function = g mod p where p is prime
  * Alice and Bob publically agree to use p = 23, g = 5
  * Alice chooses secret 6
    * sends Bob 5^6 mod 23 = 8
  * Bob chooses secret 15
    * sends alice 5 ^ 15 mod 23 = 19
  * Alice computes s = 19 ^ 6 mod 23 = 2
  * Bob computes s = 8^15 mod 23 = 2
  * symmetric key is 2
* public key 
  * pairs of key one to encrypt, one to decrypt
  * encryption key can be published, decryption key is gone
* DOS attack
  * attack on availablity
* trusted computing base
  * think carefuly about what you trust with your data
