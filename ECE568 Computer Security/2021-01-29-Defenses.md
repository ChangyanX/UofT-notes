# 2021-01-29 Defenses

* Buffer Overflow Defenses
  * Audit
  * Use type-safe language with bounds checking
  * memory safety: compiler enforces memory access rules
  * not always possible
    * legacy code
    * unavailable src
    * performance
    * C easy to write without correct checks
* separate control stack fro data
  * have two separate stacks
  * split data from instructions
  * attack requires 3 steps
    * control over RA location
    * overwrite location with guessed addr
    * inject ACE
  * stackshield
    * put RA on separate stack without data buffer
  * stack canaries (stackguard)
    * random canary placed just before return address
    * before function returns, code checks canary
    * if canary changed, program halts
    * GCC, MSVC++ supports
    * not foolproof, attacker can possibly leak canary
      * only protects against some simple buffer overflows
    * does not protect against printf or double free that go straight for RA
    * second copy of canary on the heap---much harder to overwrite
* dynamic safe libc versions
    * using ld.so.preload
    * done at runtime
    * intercepts calls to dangerous functions
* ASLR
  * randomize target addresses
  * OS maps stack randomly
  * heap, stack are slightly different, making it hard to perform return into libc or GOT overwrites
  * attacker not able to easily guess target, program will halt
* NX
  * if stack is made NX, shellcode on stack will not execute
  * page tables will have NX bit
  * needs OS support
  * non-injection attacks still possible
    * ROPs, return into libc, argument overwrite
* static analysis
  * LGTM: automated scans
  * flawfinder: c++/c source analysis
* software vuln databases
  * National vulnerability databases
  * CERT
  * SecurityFocus
  * Bugtraq
  * OSVDB
* conclusion
  * easy to make a mistake
  * exploiting takes a bit of work, but not impossibe
  * some vulns removable by using a safer language
    * lots of vulns because of raw pointers, unchecked bounds
  *
